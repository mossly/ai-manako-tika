# AI Manako Tika - Legislative RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide semantic search capabilities over Cook Islands legislation and regulations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of agentic AI tools as a human-computer interface, emphasizing:

- **Semantic Search**: Natural language querying of legislative documents
- **RAG Architecture**: Vector embeddings and retrieval for accurate, contextual responses
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI-assisted development with strategic human oversight
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Demonstrating accelerated development cycles through AI tooling

## Project Name

"Manako Tika" is Cook Islands Māori for "to search correctly" or "accurate vision" - reflecting the project's goal of providing precise access to legislative information.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages modern AI and web technologies to create an accessible interface for legal document search and retrieval.

## Purpose

This serves as a practical demonstration of how AI can:
- Abstract away lower-level operational complexity
- Enable rapid prototyping and deployment
- Provide domain-specific knowledge access through natural language interfaces
- Maintain governance through version control and CI/CD practices

## Development Approach

The project showcases end-to-end AI-assisted development, from initial architecture through deployment, while maintaining human oversight for strategic decisions and architectural choices.
