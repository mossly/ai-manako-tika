Section 2 — Adjustment of Quotas
The Fund shall at intervals of ﬁve years review , and if it deems it appropriate propose an
adjustment of, the quotas of the members. It may also, if it thinks ﬁt, consider at any other

and no quota shall be changed without the consent of the member concerned.
Section 3 — Subscriptions: Time, Place, and Form of Payment
(a) The subscription of each member shall be equal to its quota and shall be paid

member becomes eligible under Article XX, section 4(c) or (d), to buy
currencies from the Fund.
(b) Each member shall pay in gold, as a minimum, the smaller of;
(i) T wenty-ﬁve per cent of its quota; or
(ii) T en per cent of its net of f icial holdings of gold and United States dollars

transactions.
Each member shall furnish to the Fund the data necessary to determine its net
of f icial holdings of gold and United Stated dollars.
(c) Each member shall pay the balance of its quota in its own currency .

after the date of the consent, pay to the member an amount equal to the

the Fund if the change does not af fect the international transactions of members

policies of the member proposing the change.
Section 6 — Ef fect of Unauthorised Changes
If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the objection of the Fund, in
cases where the Fund is entitled to object, the member shall be ineligible to use the

currencies of all members, provided each such change is approved by every member
which has 10 per cent or more of the total of the quotas. The par value of a member’s
currency shall, however, not be changed under this provision if, within 72 hours of the
Fund’s action, the member informs the Fund that it does not wish the par value of its
currency to be changed by such action.
Section 8 — Maintenance of Gold V alue of the Fund’s Assets

shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its own currency
equal to the reduction in the gold value of its currency held by the Fund.
(c) Whenever the par value of a member’s currency is increased, the Fund shall
return to such member within a reasonable time an amount in its currency equal
to the increase in the gold value of its currency held by the Fund.
(d) The provisions of this section shall apply to a uniform proportionate change in
the par values of the currencies of all members, unless at the time when such
a change is proposed the Fund decides otherwise.
Section 9 — Separate Currencies Within a Member’s T erritories

declares otherwise, to be proposing a corresponding change in the par value of the
separate currencies of all territories in respect of which it has accepted this Agreement
under Article XX, section 2(g). It shall, however, be open to a member to declare that its

territories, the member whose holdings of such currency (or gold) have
thus increased shall use the increase to repurchase its own currency from
the Fund.
(c) None of the adjustments described in (b) above shall be carried to a point at

Scarce Currencies
Section 1 — General Scarcity of Currency
If the Fund ﬁnds that a general scarcity of a particular currency is developing, the Fund
may so inform members and may issue a report setting forth the causes of the scarcity and
containing recommendations designed to bring it to an end. A representative of the
member whose currency is involved shall participate in the preparation of the report.
Section 2 — Measures to Replenish the Fund’s Holdings or Scarce Currencies
The Fund may , if it deems such action appropriate to replenish its holdings of any

Fund and the member, the latter lend its currency to the Fund or that,
with the approval of the member, the Fund borrow such currency from
some other source either within or outside the territories of the member,

Fund or to approve the borrowing of its currency by the Fund from any
other source:
(ii) Require the member to sell its currency to the Fund for gold.
Section 3 — Scarcity of the Fund’s Holdings
(a) If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a Member’s currency
seriously threatens the Fund’s ability to supply that currency , the Fund, whether

such currency scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its existing and accruing
supply of the scarce currency with due regard to the relative needs of members,
the general international economic situation, and or any other pertinent
considerations. The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.
(b) A formal declaration under (a) above shall operate as an authorisation to any
member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on
the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency . Subject to the
provisions of Article IV , sections 3 and 4, the member shall have complete
jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations, but they shall be no
more restrictive than is necessary to limit the demand for the scarce currency
to the supply held by , or accruing to, the member in question; and they shall be
relaxed and removed as rapidly as conditions permit.
(c) The authorisation under (b) above shall expire whenever the Fund formally
declares the currency in question to be no longer scarce.
Section 4 — Administration of Restrictions
Any member imposing restrictions in respect of the currency of any other member
pursuant to the provisions of section 3(b) of this article shall give sympathetic

its of f icial holdings of gold and United States currency after deducting central

exchange transactions, it shall so notify the members and shall request each
member to communicate within 30 days the par value of its currency based on
the rates of exchange prevailing on the sixtieth day before the entry into force
of this Agreement. No member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied
by the enemy shall be required to make such a communication while that
territory is a theatre of major hostilities or for such period thereafter as the
Fund may determine. When such a member communicates the par value of its
currency the provisions of (d) below shall apply .
(b) The par value communicated by a member whose metropolitan territory has
not been occupied by the enemy shall be the par value of that member’s
currency for the purposes of this Agreement unless, within 90 days after the
request referred to in (a) above has been received, (i) the member notiﬁes the
Fund that it regards the par value as unsatisfactory , or (ii) the Fund notiﬁes the
member that in its opinion the par value cannot be maintained without causing
recourse to the Fund on the part of that member or others on a scale prejudicial
Sch 1 INTERNA TIONAL FINANCE AGREEMENTS ACT 1961
Service 0116,705

on the Fund and to members. When notiﬁcation is given under (i) or (ii) above,
the Fund and the member shall, within a period determined by the Fund in the
light of all relevant circumstances, agree upon a suitable par value for that
currency . If the Fund and the member do not agree within the period so
determined, the member shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Fund on
the date when the period expires.
(c) When the par value of a member’s currency has been established under (b)
above, either by the expiration of 90 days without notiﬁcation, or by agreement
after notiﬁcation, the member shall be eligible to buy from the Fund the
currencies of other members to the full extent permitted in this Agreement,
provided that the Fund has begun exchange transactions.
(d) In the case of a member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the
enemy , the provisions of (b) above shall apply , subject to the following
modiﬁcations:
(i) The period of 90 days shall be extended so as to end on a date to be ﬁxed
by agreement between the Fund and the member:
(ii) Within the extended period the member may , if the Fund has begun
exchange transactions, buy from the Fund with its currency the
currencies of other members, but only under such conditions and in such
amounts as may be prescribed by the Fund:
(iii) At any time before the date ﬁxed under (i) above, changes may be made
by agreement with the Fund in the par value communicated under (a)
above.
(e) If a member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the enemy
adopts a new monetary unit before the date to be ﬁxed under (d)(i) above, the
par value ﬁxed by that member for the new unit shall be communicated to the
Fund and the provisions of (d) above shall apply .
(f) Changes in par values agreed with the Fund under this section shall not be
taken into account in determining whether a proposed change falls within (i),

(g) A member communicating to the Fund a par value for the currency of its
metropolitan territory shall simultaneously communicate a value, in terms of
that currency , for each separate currency , where such exists, in the territories in
respect of which it has accepted this Agreement under section 2(g) of this
article, but no member shall be required to make a communication for the
separate currency of a territory which has been occupied by the enemy while
that territory is a theatre of major hostilities or for such period thereafter as the
Fund may determine. On the basis of the par value so communicated, the Fund
shall compute the par value of each separate currency . A communication of
notiﬁcation to the Fund under (a), (b), or (d) above regarding the par value of
a currency , shall also be deemed, unless the contrary is stated, to be a
communication or notiﬁcation regarding the par value of all the separate
currencies referred to above. Any member may , however, make a
communication or notiﬁcation relating to the metropolitan or any of the
separate currencies alone. If the member does so, the provisions of the
preceding paragraphs (including (d) above, if a territory where a separate
currency exists has been occupied by the enemy) shall apply to each of these
currencies separately .
(h) The Fund shall begin exchange transactions at such date as it may determine
after members having 65 per cent of the total of the quotas set forth in Schedule
Sch 1LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 116,706

A have become eligible, in accordance with the preceding paragraphs of this
section, to purchase the currencies of other members, but in no event until after
major hostilities in Europe have ceased.
(i) The Fund may postpone exchange transactions with any member if its
circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the Fund, they would lead to use
of the resources of the Fund in a manner contrary to the purposes of this
Agreement or prejudicial to the Fund or the members.
(j) The par values of the currencies of governments which indicate their desire to
become members after 31 December 1945 shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of Article II, section 2.

If the member’s monetary reserves have not increased during the year, the

(b) If the member’s monetary reserves have increased during the year, a part of the
amount payable to the Fund equal to one-half of the increase shall be distributed
among those types of reserves which have increased in proportion to the amount by
which each of them has increased. The remainder of the sum payable to the Fund
shall be distributed among all types of reserves in proportion to the member’s
remaining holdings thereof:
(c) If after all the repurchases required under Article V , section 7(b), had been made,
the result would exceed any of the limits speciﬁed in Article V , section 7(c), the

such manner that the limits will not be exceeded.
2. The Fund shall not acquire the currency of any non-member under Article V , section

3. In calculating monetary reserves and the increase in monetary reserves during any
year for the purpose of Article V , section 7(b) and (c), no account shall be taken,
unless deductions have otherwise been made by the member for such holdings, of any
increase in those monetary reserves which is due to currency previously inconvertible
having become convertible during the year; or to holdings which are the proceeds of
a long-term or medium-term loan contracted during the year; or to holdings which
have been transferred or set aside for repayment of a loan during the subsequent year.
4. In the case of members whose metropolitan territories have been occupied by the
enemy , gold newly produced during the ﬁve years after the entry into force of this

acquire it by purchase from the Fund, to the extent that such member has access to the
resources of the Fund and that such currency is available under 4 above.

months of the date on which the member withdraws, the account between the Fund
and that government shall be settled in accordance with Article XVI, section 2, and

currencies are held by the Fund in amounts less than their quotas. These members
shall share the gold so distributed in the proportions of the amounts by which their
quotas exceed the Fund’s holdings of their currencies:
(b) The Fund shall distribute to each member one-half the Fund’s holdings of its
currency but such distribution shall not exceed 50 per cent of its quota:
(c) The Fund shall apportion the remainder of its holdings of each currency among
all the members in proportion to the amounts due to each member after the
distributions under (a) and (b) above.
3. Each member shall redeem the holdings of its currency apportioned to other members
under 2(c) above, and shall agree with the Fund within three months after a decision
to liquidate upon an orderly procedure for such redemption.

referred to in 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members apportioned
to that member under 2(c) above to redeem the currency of that member apportioned
to other members. Each currency apportioned to a member which has not reached
agreement shall be used, so far as possible, to redeem its currency apportioned to the
members which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above.
5. If a member has reached agreement with the Fund in accordance with 3 above, the
Fund shall use the currencies of other members apportioned to that member under
2(c) above to redeem the currency of that member apportioned to other members
which have made agreements with the Fund under 3 above. Each amount so redeemed
shall be redeemed in the currency of the member to which it was apportioned.
6. After carrying out the preceding paragraphs, the Fund shall pay to each member the
remaining currencies held for its account.

Article 13
Provision of Currencies for Direct Loans
In making direct loans or participating in them, the Bank may provide ﬁnancing in any of
the following ways:

necessary to meet the foreign exchange costs of such project; or
(ii) by providing ﬁnancing to meet local expenditures on the project
concerned, where it can do so by supplying local currency without
selling any of its holdings in gold or convertible currencies. In special
cases when, in the opinion of the Bank, the project causes or is likely to
cause undue loss or strain on the balance of payments of the member in
whose territory the project is to be carried out, the ﬁnancing granted by

granted by the Bank for this purpose shall not exceed a reasonable
portion of the total local expenditure incurred by the borrower.

speciﬁc projects, including those forming part of a national, sub-regional
or regional development programme. They may , however, include loans
to, or guarantees of loans made to, national development banks or other
suitable entities, in order that the latter may ﬁnance speciﬁc development
projects whose individual ﬁnancing requirements are not, in the opinion
of the Bank, large enough to warrant the direct supervision of the Bank;
and
(ii) In selecting suitable projects, the Bank shall always be guided by the
provisions of paragraph (ii) of Article 2 of this Agreement;
(iii) The Bank shall not ﬁnance any undertaking in the territory of a member
if that member objects to such ﬁnancing;
(iv) Before a loan is granted, the applicant shall have submitted an adequate
loan proposal and the President of the Bank shall have presented to the
Board of Directors a written report regarding the proposal, together with
his recommendations, on the basis of a staf f study;
(v) In considering an application for a loan or guarantee, the Bank shall pay
due regard to the ability of the borrower to obtain ﬁnancing or facilities
elsewhere on terms and conditions that the Bank considers reasonable
for the recipient, taking into account all pertinent factors;
(vi) In making or guaranteeing a loan, the Bank shall pay due regard to the
prospects that the borrower and its guarantor, if any , will be in a position
to meet their obligations under the loan contract;
(vii) In making or guaranteeing a loan, the rate of interest, other charges and
the schedule for repayment of principal shall be such as are, in the
opinion of the Bank, appropriate for the loan concerned;
Sch 1 INTERNA TIONAL FINANCE AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT ACT 1966
Service 0122,507

(viii) In guaranteeing a loan made by other investors, or in underwriting the
sale of securities, the Bank shall receive suitable compensation for its
risk;
(ix) The proceeds of any loan, investment or other ﬁnancing undertaken in
the ordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds established by

procurement in member countries of goods and services produced in
member countries, except in any case in which the Board of Directors,
by a vote of the Directors representing not less than two-thirds of the
total voting power of the members, determine to permit procurement in
a non-member country or of goods and services produced in a
non-member country in special circumstances making such procurement
appropriate, as in the case of a non-member country in which a
signiﬁcant amount of ﬁnancing has been provided to the Bank;
(x) In the case of a direct loan made by the Bank, the borrower shall be
permitted by the Bank to draw its funds only to meet expenditures in
connexion with the project as they are actually incurred;
(xi) The Bank shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the proceeds
of any loan made, guaranteed or participated in by the Bank are used
only for the purposes for which the loan was granted and with due
attention to considerations of economy and ef f iciency;
(xii) The Bank shall pay due regard to the desirability of avoiding a
disproportionate amount of its resources being used for the beneﬁt of any
member;
(xiii) The Bank shall seek to maintain reasonable diversiﬁcation in its
investments in equity capital; it shall not assume responsibility for
managing any entity or enterprise in which it has an investment, except
where necessary to safeguard its investments; and
(xiv) The Bank shall be guided by sound banking principles in its operations.

instrumentality of that member acceptable to the Bank, guarantee the
repayment of the principal and the payment of interest and other charges on the
loan in accordance with the terms thereof.

payments to the Bank thereunder shall be made. At the option of the borrower,
however, such payments may always be made in gold or convertible currency .

amortization on borrowings of the Bank in its ordinary operations, or to meet
its liabilities with respect to similar payments in respect of loans guaranteed by
it, chargeable to its ordinary capital resources, the Bank may call an

total subscriptions of the members to such capital, for the following purposes:

economy and balanced growth of international trade foster international relationships

(a) In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and cancellation of
special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to meet the long-term global
need, as and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets in
such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will
avoid economic stagnation and deﬂation as well as excess demand and
inﬂation in the world.
(b) The ﬁrst decision to allocate special drawing rights shall take into
account, as special considerations, a collective judgment that there is a
global need to supplement reserves, and the attainment of a better
balance of payments equilibrium, as well as the likelihood of a better
working of the adjustment process in the future.
Section 2 — Allocation and Cancellation
(a) Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing rights shall
be made for basic periods which shall run consecutively and shall be
ﬁve years in duration. The ﬁrst basic period shall begin on the date of
the ﬁrst decision to allocate special drawing rights or such later date as
may be speciﬁed in that decision. Any allocations or cancellations
shall take place at yearly intervals.
(b) The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be expressed as
percentages of quotas on the date of each decision to allocate. The
rates at which special drawing rights are to be cancelled shall be
expressed as percentages of net cumulative allocations of special
drawing rights on the date of each decision to cancel. The percentages
shall be the same for all participants.
(c) In its decision for any basic period the Fund may provide,
notwithstanding (a) and (b) above, that:
(i) The duration of the basic period shall be other than ﬁve years; or

decides that the new participant shall start to receive allocations
beginning with the next allocation after it becomes a participant. If the
Fund decides that a member that becomes a participant during a basic
period shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic
period and the participant was not a member on the dates established
under (b) or (c) above, the Fund shall determine the basis on which
these allocations to the participant shall be made.
(e) A participant shall receive allocations of special drawing rights made
pursuant to any decision to allocate unless:
(i) The governor for the participant did not vote in favour of the decision; and
(ii) The participant has notiﬁed the Fund in writing prior to the ﬁrst allocation
of special drawing rights under that decision that it does not wish special
drawing rights to be allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a
participant, the Fund may decide to terminate the ef fect of the notice with
respect to allocations of special drawing rights subsequent to the
termination.

drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share of the special
drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the participant shall eliminate
its negative balance as promptly as its gross reserve position permits
and shall remain in consultation with the Fund for this purpose.
Special drawing rights acquired by the participant after the ef fective
date of the cancellation shall be applied against its negative balance
and cancelled.

convertible currency and each of the other types of monetary reserve, the
following rule, subject to 2 below , shall apply:
(a) If the member’s monetary reserves have not increased during the
year, the amount payable to the Fund shall be distributed among all
types of reserves in proportion to the member’s holdings thereof at
the end of the year.
(b) If the member’s monetary reserves have increased during the year, a
part of the amount payable to the Fund equal to one-half of the
increase, minus one-half of any decrease in the Fund’s holdings of
the member’s currency that has occurred during the year, shall be
distributed among those types of reserves which have increased in
proportion to the amount by which each of them has increased. The
remainder of the sum payable to the Fund shall be distributed among
all types of reserves in proportion to the member’s remaining
holdings thereof.
(c) If after the repurchases required under Article V , section 7(b), had
been made, the result would exceed either of the limits speciﬁed in
Article V , section 7(c)(i) or (ii), the Fund shall require such
repurchases to be made by the member proportionately in such
manner that these limits will not be exceeded.

(d) If after all the repurchases required under Article V , section 7(b), had
been made, the result would exceed the limit speciﬁed in Article V ,
section 7(c)(iii), the amount by which the limit would be exceeded
shall be discharged in convertible currencies as determined by the
Fund without exceeding that limit.
(e) If a repurchase required under Article V , section 7(b), would exceed
the limit speciﬁed in Article V , section 7(c)(iv), the amount by which
the limit would be exceeded shall be repurchased at the end of the
subsequent ﬁnancial year or years in such a way that total
repurchases under Article V , section 7(b), in any year would not
exceed the limit speciﬁed in Article V , section 7(c)(iv).”

(a) The Fund shall not acquire the currency of any non-member under
Article V , section 7(b) and (c).
(b) Any amount payable in the currency of a non-member under 1(a) or

3 The following paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be added to Schedule B:
“5 In calculating monetary reserves and the increase in monetary reserves
during any year for the purpose of Article V , section 7(b) and (c), the Fund

shall be made for obligations outstanding as the result of transactions
between members under a reciprocal facility by which a member agrees to
exchange on demand its currency for the currency of the other member up
to a maximum amount and on terms requiring that each such transaction be
reversed within a speciﬁed period not in excess of nine months.
“6 In calculating monetary reserves and the increase in monetary reserves for
the purpose of Article V , section 7(b) and (c), Article XIX(e) shall apply
except that the following provision shall apply at the end of a ﬁnancial year

A member’s monetary reserves shall be calculated by deducting from its
central holdings the currency liabilities to the Treasuries, central banks,
stablization funds, or similar ﬁscal agencies of other members or
non-members speciﬁed under (d) above, together with similar liabilities to
other of f icial institutions and other banks in the territories of members, or
non-members speciﬁed under (d) above. T o these net holdings shall be
added the sums deemed to be of f icial holdings of other of f icial institutions
and other banks under (c) above.”

The following Schedules shall be added after Schedule E:
Schedule F — Designation
During the ﬁrst basic period the rules for designation shall be as follows:
(a) Participants subject to designation under Article XXV , section 5(a)(i),
shall be designated for such amounts as will promote over time
equality in the ratios of the participants’ holdings of special drawing
rights in excess of their net cumulative allocations to their of f icial
holdings of gold and foreign exchange.
Sch INTERNA TIONAL FINANCE AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT ACT 1968
Service 0128,907

(b) The formula to give ef fect to (a) above shall be such that participants
subject to designation shall be designated:
(i) In proportion to their of f icial holdings of gold and foreign exchange when
the ratios described in (a) above are equal; and
(ii) In such manner as gradually to reduce the dif ference between the ratios
described in (a) above that are low and the ratios that are high.
Schedule G — Reconstitution
1 During the ﬁrst basic period the rules for reconstitution shall be as
follows:
(a)
(i) A participant shall so use and reconstitute its holdings of special
drawing rights that, ﬁve years after the ﬁrst allocation and at the end
of each calendar quarter thereafter, the average of its total daily
holdings of special drawing rights over the most recent ﬁve-year
period will be not less than thirty percent of the average of its daily
net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights over the same
period.
(ii) T wo years after the ﬁrst allocation and at the end of each calendar
month thereafter the Fund shall make calculations for each
participant so as to ascertain whether and to what extent the
participant would need to acquire special drawing rights between the
date of the calculation and the end of any ﬁve-year period in order to
comply with the requirement in (a)(i) above. The Fund shall adopt
regulations with respect to the bases on which these calculations
shall be made and with respect to the timing of the designation of
participants under Article XXV , section 5 (a) (ii), in order to assist
them to comply with the requirement in (a)(i) above.
(iii) The Fund shall give special notice to a participant when the
calculations under (a)(ii) above indicate that it is unlikely that the
participant will be able to comply with the requirement in (a)(i)
above unless it ceases to use special drawing rights for the rest of the
period for which the calculation was made under (a)(ii) above.
(iv) A participant that needs to acquire special drawing rights to fulﬁll
this obligation shall be obligated and entitled to obtain them, at its
option for gold or currency acceptable to the Fund, in a transaction
with the Fund conducted through the General Account. If suf f icient
special drawing rights to fulﬁll this obligation cannot be obtained in
this way , the participant shall be obligated and entitled to obtain
them with currency convertible in fact from a participant which the
Fund shall specify .
(b) Participants shall also pay due regard to the desirability of pursuing over
time a balanced relationship between their holdings of special drawing
rights and their holdings of gold and foreign exchange and their reserve
positions in the Fund. 2. If a participant fails to comply with the rules for
reconstitution, the Fund shall determine whether or not the circumstances
justify suspension under Article XXIX, section 2(b).
Schedule H — T ermination of participation
1 If the obligation remaining after the setof f under Article XXX, section
2(b), is to the terminating participant and agreement on settlement
SchLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 128,908

between the Fund and the terminating participant is not reached within
six months of the date of termination, the Fund shall redeem this
balance of special drawing rights in equal half-yearly installments
within a maximum of ﬁve years of the date of termination. The Fund
shall redeem this balance as it may determine, either (a) by the
payment to the terminating participant of the amounts provided by the
remaining participants to the Fund in accordance with Article XXX,
section 5, or (b) by permitting the terminating participant to use its
special drawing rights to obtain its own currency or currency
convertible in fact from a participant speciﬁed by the Fund, the
General Account, or any other holder.
2 If the obligation remaining after the setof f under Article XXX, section
2(b), is to the Fund and agreement on settlement is not reached within
six months of the date of termination, the terminating participant shall
discharge this obligation in equal half-yearly installments within three
years of the date of termination or within such longer period as may be
ﬁxed by the Fund. The terminating participant shall discharge this
obligation, as the Fund may determine, either (a) by the payment to the
Fund of currency convertible in fact or gold at the option of the
terminating participant, or (b) by obtaining special drawing rights, in
accordance with Article XXX, section 6, from the General Account or
in agreement with a participant speciﬁed by the Fund or from any
other holder, and the setof f of these special drawing rights against the
installment due.
3 Installments under either 1 or 2 above shall fall due six months after
the date of termination and at intervals of six months thereafter.
4 In the event of the Special Drawing Account going into liquidation
under Article XXXI within six months of the date a participant
terminates its participation, the settlement between the Fund and that
government shall be made in accordance with Article XXXI and
Schedule I.
Schedule I — Administration of liquidation of the Special Drawing Account
1 In the event of liquidation of the Special Drawing Account,
participants shall discharge their obligations to the Fund in ten
half-yearly installments, or in such longer period as the Fund may
decide is needed, in currency convertible in fact and the currencies of
participants holding special drawing rights to be redeemed in any
installment to the extent of such redemption, as determined by the
Fund. The ﬁrst half-yearly payment shall be made six months after the
decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Account.
2 If it is decided to liquidate the Fund within six months of the date of
the decision to liquidate the Special Drawing Account, the liquidation
of the Special Drawing Account shall not proceed until special
drawing rights held in the General Account have been distributed in
accordance with the following rule:
After the distribution made under 2(a) of Schedule E, the Fund shall
apportion its special drawing rights held in the General Account among all
members that are participants in proportion to the amounts due to each
participant after the distribution under 2(a). T o determine the amount due
to each member for the purpose of apportioning the remainder of its
Sch INTERNA TIONAL FINANCE AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT ACT 1968
Service 0128,909

holdings of each currency under 2(c) of Schedule E, the Fund shall deduct
the distribution of special drawing rights made under this rule.
3 With the amounts received under 1 above, the Fund shall redeem
special drawing rights held by holders in the following manner and
order:
(a) Special drawing rights held by governments that have terminated their
participation more than six months before the date the Board of Governors
decides to liquidate the Special Drawing Account shall be redeemed in
accordance with the terms of any agreement under Article XXX or
Schedule H.
(b) Special drawing rights held by holders that are not participants shall be
redeemed before those held by participants, and shall be redeemed in
proportion to the amount held by each holder.
(c) The Fund shall determine the proportion of special drawing rights held by
each participant in relation to its net cumulative allocation. The Fund shall
ﬁrst redeem special drawing rights from the participants with the highest
proportion until this proportion is reduced to that of the second highest
proportion; the Fund shall then redeem the special drawing rights held by
these participants in accordance with their net cumulative allocations until
the proportions are reduced to that of the third highest proportion; and this
process shall be continued until the amount available for redemption is
exhausted.
4 Any amount that a participant will be entitled to receive in redemption
under 3 above shall be set of f against any amount to be paid under 1
above.
5 During liquidation the Fund shall pay interest on the amount of special
drawing rights held by holders, and each participant shall pay charges
on the net cumulative allocation of special drawing rights to it less the
amount of any payments made in accordance with 1 above. The rates
of interest and charges and the time of payment shall be determined by
the Fund. Payments of interest and charges shall be made in special
drawing rights to the extent possible. A participant that does not hold
suf f icient special drawing rights to meet any charges shall make the
payment with gold or a currency speciﬁed by the Fund. Special
drawing rights received as charges in amounts needed for
administrative expenses shall not be used for the payment of interest,
but shall be transferred to the Fund and shall be redeemed ﬁrst and
with the currencies used by the Fund to meet its expenses.
6 While a participant is in default with respect to any payment required
by 1 or 5 above, no amounts shall be paid to it in accordance with 2
or 5 above.
7 If after the ﬁnal payments have been made to participants each
participant not in default does not hold special drawing rights in the
same proportion to its net cumulative allocation, those participants
holding a lower proportion shall purchase from those holding a higher
proportion such amounts in accordance with arrangements made by
the Fund as will make the proportion of their holdings of special
drawing rights the same. Each participant in default shall pay to the
Fund its own currency in an amount equal to its default. The Fund
shall apportion this currency and any residual claims among
participants in proportion to the amount of special drawing rights held
SchLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 128,910

by each and these special drawing rights shall be cancelled. The Fund
shall then close the books of the Special Drawing Account and all of
the Fund’s liabilities arising from the allocations of special drawing
rights and the administration of the Special Drawing Account shall
cease.
8 Each participant whose currency is distributed to other participants
under this Schedule guarantees the unrestricted use of such currency at
all time for the purchase of goods or for payments of sums due to it or
to persons in its territories. Each participant so obligated agrees to
compensate other participants for any loss resulting from the
dif ference between the value at which the Fund distributed its currency
under this Schedule and the value realized by such participants on
disposal of its currency .”
