An Act to make provision for the control in New Zealand of the means of producing
atomic energy and for that purpose to provide for the control of the mining and treatment
of the ores of uranium and other elements which may be used for the production of atomic
energy , and to provide for the vesting of such substances in the Crown.
1 Short Title
This Act may be cited as the Atomic Energy Act 1945.
2 Interpretation
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,—
atomic energy means the energy released from atomic nuclei as a result of any
process, including the ﬁssion process; but does not include energy released in
any process of natural transmutation or radioactive decay which is not
accelerated or inﬂuenced by external means
Minister means the Minister of Mines
Minister for Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research means the Minister for the
time being charged with the administration of the Scientiﬁc and Industrial
Research Act 1952
New Zealand includes any territory subject to the protection, mandate,
trusteeship, or authority of the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand,
including the Cook Islands
prescribed substance means uranium, thorium, plutonium, neptunium, or any
of their respective compounds, or any such other substance as the Minister may
prescribe by notice in the Gazette, being a substance which in his opinion is or
may be used for the production of atomic energy or research into matters
connected therewith
uranium includes thorium and all natural substances, chemical compounds, and
physical combinations of uranium or thorium.
[Section 2(1) atomic energy: replaced, on 4 October 1957, by section 2(1) of the Atomic Energy
Amendment Act 1957 (1957 No 12).]
