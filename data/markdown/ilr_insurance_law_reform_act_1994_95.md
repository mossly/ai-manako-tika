An Act to ef fect certain reforms in the law governing contracts of insurance
BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of the Cook Islands in Session assembled, and by
authority of the same, as follows:
1 Short title
This Act may be cited as the Insurance Law Reform Act 1994–95.
2 Interpretation
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,—
company has the meaning ascribed to that term by section 2 of the Life
Insurance Act 1970–71
continuous disability insurance contract means a contract of insurance (which
is by its terms to be of more than 1 year’s duration and is incorporated in a life
policy) whereby any person is to be entitled to a beneﬁt in the event of the
occurrence, within the duration of the contract, of death by accident or by some
other cause speciﬁed in the contract, or of injury or disability caused by accident
or sickness
life policy means a policy insuring payment of money on death (not being death
by accident or speciﬁed sickness only) or on the happening of any contingency
dependent on the termination or continuance of human life (either with or
without provision for a beneﬁt under a continuous disability insurance contract);
and includes an instrument evidencing a contract which is subject to the
payment of premiums for a term dependent on the termination or continuance of
human life and an instrument securing the grant of an annuity for a term
dependent upon human life.
3 Application of Act
(1) This Act applies in relation to life policies whether issued, reinstated, or
renewed before or after the commencement of this Act:
Provided that nothing in this subsection af fects—
(a) the rights of any claimant under a life policy if the event giving rise to the
claim occurred before the commencement of this Act; or
(b) the rights of the parties under any judgment given in any court before the
commencement of this Act, or under any judgment, whether the appeal is
commenced before or after the commencement of this Act; or
(c) the rights of the parties to any award made—
(i) before the commencement of this Act following the reference of
any matter to arbitration; or
(ii) after the commencement of this Act following the setting aside of
an award made before the commencement of this Act; or
(d) in the case of an award to which paragraph (c) of this proviso applies, the
rights of the parties to any proceedings by way of appeal against the
making of any such award or for the setting aside of any such award.
4 Act binds the Crown
This Act binds the Crown.
5 Misstatements in contracts of life insurance
(1) A life policy must not be avoided by reason only of any statement (other than a
statement as to the age of the life insured) made in any proposal or other
document on the faith of which the policy was issued, reinstated, or renewed by
the company unless the statement—
s 5 INSURANCE LA W REFORM ACT 1994–95
Service 040,301

(a) was substantially incorrect; and
(b) was material; and
(c) was made either—
(i) fraudulently; or
(ii) within the period of 3 years immediately preceding the date on
which the policy is sought to be avoided or the date of the death
of the life insured, whichever is the earlier.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c)(i), a statement is made fraudulently if the
person making it makes it—
(a) knowing it is incorrect; or
(b) without belief in its correctness; or
(c) recklessly , without caring whether it is correct or not.
6 Misstatements in other contracts of insurance
(1) A contract of insurance may not be avoided by reason only of any statement
made in any proposal or other document on the faith of which the contract was
entered into, reinstated, or renewed by the insurer unless the statement—
(a) was substantially incorrect; and
(b) was material.
(2) Nothing in this section—
(a) applies in respect of any contract of insurance embodied in a life policy;
or
(b) limits the provisions of sections 5 and 8.
7 Incorrectness and materiality deﬁned
(1) For the purposes of sections 5 and 6, and despite any admission, term, condition,
stipulation, warranty , or proviso in the application or proposal for insurance or
in the life policy or contract of insurance, a statement is substantially incorrect
only if the dif ference between what is stated and what is actually correct would
have been considered material by a prudent insurer.
(2) For the purposes of sections 5 and 6, and despite any admission, term, condition,
stipulation, warranty , or proviso in the application or proposal for insurance or
in the life policy or contract of insurance, a statement is material only if that
statement would have inﬂuenced the judgment of a prudent insurer in ﬁxing the
premium or in determining whether the insurer would have taken or continued
the risk upon substantially the same terms.
8 Misstatement of age
(1) A life policy is not avoided by reason only of a misstatement of the age of the
life insured.
(2) Where the true age as shown by the proofs is greater than that on which the
policy was based, the company may vary the sum insured by , and the bonuses
(if any) allotted to, the policy so that, as varied, they bear the same proportion
to the sum insured by , and the bonuses (if any) allotted to, the policy before
variation as the amount of the premiums that have become payable under the
policy as issued, bears to the amount of the premiums that would have become
payable if the policy had been based on the true age.
(3) Where the true age as shown by the proofs is less than that on which the policy
was based, the company must either—
s 5LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 40,302

(a) vary the sum insured by , and the bonuses (if any) allotted to the policy so
that, as varied, they bear the same proportion to the sum insured by , and
the bonuses (if any) allotted to, the policy variation as the amount of the
premiums that have become payable under the policy as issued, bears to
the amount of the premiums that would have become payable if the
policy had been based on the true age; or
(b) reduce, as from the date of issue of the policy , the premium payable to the
amount that would have been payable if the policy had been based on the
true age and repay to the policy owner the amount of overpayments of
premium less any amount that has been paid as the cash value of bonuses
in excess of the cash value that would have been paid if the policy had
been based on the true age.
9 Arbitration clauses not binding
(1) Subject to subsection (2), a provision of a contract of insurance—
(a) requiring dif ferences or disputes arising out of or in relation to the
contract to be referred to arbitration; or
(b) providing that no action or suit is maintainable upon the contract or
against the insurer in respect of any claim under or dif ference or dispute
arising out of or in relation to the contract unless the issue, claim,
dif ference, or dispute has ﬁrst been referred to arbitration or an award in
arbitration proceedings has been ﬁrst obtained; or
(c) providing that arbitration or an award in arbitration proceedings is a
condition precedent to any right of action or suit upon or in relation to the
contract; or
(d) imposing by reference to arbitration or to an award in arbitration
proceedings any limitation on the right of any person to bring or maintain
an action or suit upon or in relation to the contract,—
must not bind the insured.
(2) An agreement made by the parties to a contract of insurance after a dif ference
or dispute has arisen out of or in relation to the contract to submit the dif ference
or dispute to arbitration, has ef fect as if subsection (1) had not been enacted.
10 Time limits on claims under contracts of insurance
(1) A provision of a contract of insurance prescribing any manner in which or any
limit of time within which notice of any claim by the insured under such
contract must be given, or prescribing any limit of time within which any suit or
action by the insured must be brought must—
(a) if that contract of insurance is embodied in a life policy and the claim,
suit, or action relates to the death of the insured, not bind the insured; and
(b) in any other case, bind the insured only if in the opinion of the arbitrator
or court determining the claim the insurer has in the particular
circumstances, been so prejudiced by the failure of the insured to comply
with such provision that it would be inequitable if such provision were
not to bind the insured.
(2) Where—
(a) the insured under any contract of insurance to which subsection (1)(b)
applies fails to give notice of any claim in any manner or within any limit
of time prescribed by the contract; and
s 10 INSURANCE LA W REFORM ACT 1994–95
Service 040,303

(b) the cost of repairing, replacing, or reinstating any property when it falls
to be met is greater than that which would have applied if the notice had
been given in the manner or within the time so prescribed—
that greater cost does not constitute prejudice to the insurer for the purposes of
subsection (1)(b), but the insurer is not obliged to apply or pay in repairing,
replacing, or reinstating the property a greater sum than that for which the
insurer would have been liable if the notice of claim had been given in the
manner or within the time so prescribed.
11 Salesman, etc to be agents of insurer
(1) A representative of the insurer who acts for the insurer during the negotiation of
any contract of insurance, and so acts within the scope of his or her actual or
apparent authority , is deemed, as between the insured and the insurer and at all
times during the negotiations until the contract comes into being, to be the agent
of the insurer.
(2) An insurer is deemed to have notice of all matters material to a contract of
insurance known to a representative of the insurer concerned in the negotiation
of the contract before the proposal of the insured is accepted by the insurer.
(3) In this section the term representative of the insurer includes any servant or
employee of the insurer and any person entitled to receive from the insurer
commission or other valuable consideration in consideration for such person’s
arranging, negotiating, soliciting, or procuring the contract of insurance between
a person other than himself or herself and such insurer.
12 Certain exclusions forbidden
Where—
(a) by the provisions of a contract of insurance the circumstances in which
the insurer is bound to indemnify the insured against loss are so deﬁned
as to exclude or limit the liability of the insurer to indemnify the insured
on the happening of certain events; or on the existence of certain
circumstances; and
(b) in the view of the court or arbitrator determining the claim of the insured
the liability of the insurer has been so deﬁned because the happening of
such events or the existence of such circumstances was in the view of the
insurer likely to increase the risk of such loss occurring—
the insured is not disentitled to be indemniﬁed by the insurer by reason only of
such provisions of the contract of insurance if the insured proves on the balance
of probability that the loss in respect of which the insured seeks to be
indemniﬁed was not caused or contributed to by the happening of such events or
the existence of such circumstances.
13 Marine Insurance Act 1908 to be subject to this Act
Nothing in the Marine Insurance Act 1908 of New Zealand as applied in the
Cook Islands by section 631 of the Cook Islands Act 1915 limits any provision
of this Act, and the provisions of this Act prevail in any case where they are in
conﬂict with any provision of that Act.
14 No contracting out
The provisions of this Act have ef fect despite any provision to the contrary in
any agreement or in any contract of insurance whether such provision is
embodied in a policy or not.
