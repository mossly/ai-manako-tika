(2) If reasonable attempts by the infrastructure manager to obtain an enduring
agreement with those owners have failed, the infrastructure manager may , if
dispute resolution under section 60 is unsuccessful, apply to the Court, using the
procedures set out in section 46, and seek an order to—
(a) conﬁrm that the infrastructure manager may construct that new
infrastructure or alter that existing infrastructure; and
(b) grant the infrastructure manager whatever right or interest in the land the
Court is satisﬁed is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances; and
(c) direct the length of term and other terms and conditions (including
ﬁnancial terms and conditions) on which that right or interest is to be
granted; and
(d) determine any other appropriate compensation.

acquire native freehold land for an estate in fee simple or for any other
freehold interest, whether legal or equitable.

install other new infrastructure on land only—
(a) in accordance with an enduring agreement entered into with the owner or
owners of the land; or
(b) under an order of the Court made under section 47.
(3) For the purposes of this section, infrastructure that is installed to replace existing
infrastructure at the same location and has physical dimensions and
characteristics that are no more intrusive than that existing infrastructure, is not
new infrastructure.

Infrastructure manager may apply to Court for order concerning land
46 Application for order if owner agreement not obtained
(1) An infrastructure manager may apply to the Court for an order under section 47

(a) 1 or more owners are unable or unwilling to enter into negotiations and
dispute resolution under section 60 is unsuccessful; or
(b) negotiations between the parties have broken down or there are
unreasonably long delays in progressing negotiations and dispute
resolution under section 60 is either unsuccessful or inappropriate; or

either unsuccessful or inappropriate.
(2) If an application under this section is ﬁled by an infrastructure manager, it must
be served as direction by the Court.
(3) Without limiting subsection (2), the Court may request the Registrar to convene

Compensation
52 Overarching principle when determining issues of compensation
The overarching principle to be observed by any Court or person in deciding
issues of compensation relating to the construction, installation, or maintenance
of infrastructure is that because the provision of infrastructure is work for the
public good and beneﬁt, individuals must necessarily accept some
uncompensated loss or damage to their property and interference with
enjoyment of their property rights.
53 Applying for compensation
(1) Nothing in this Act af fects or limits the right in Article 40 of the constitution to
claim compensation in respect of any right over or interest in property acquired
compulsorily .
(2) In respect of anything other than compensation claimed under Article 40 of the
constitution, the Court may order compensation to be paid by an infrastructure
manager to an occupier or owner of land or an accessway manager (in this
section and sections 54 and 55 referred to as an applicant)—
(a) on an application for compensation by the applicant; or
(b) as a condition of any order made under section 51.
(3) An application for compensation may not be made under subsection (2)(b)
unless dispute resolution under section 60 is unsuccessful.
(4) Without limiting subsection (1), nothing in section 7(1)(b) or in any enduring
agreement that is entered into between a lessee and an infrastructure manager
af fects—
s 53 INFRASTRUCTURE ACT 2019
Service 0821,505

(a) the right to compensation of native freehold owners if land is
compulsorily acquired; or
(b) the right of native freehold owners to claim compensation for damage or
loss of a kind that continues beyond the expiry of the lease.
(5) If the infrastructure manager and the lessee enter into an enduring agreement
they must account to the native freehold owners for the owner’s entitlement (if
any) to part or all of the compensation paid by the infrastructure manager to the
lessee.
(6) If the Court makes an order under this section and there are multiple interests
held in the land that is the subject of the application, the Court must, unless the
Court considers that it would be contrary to the interests of justice or is unable
for any reason to do so, apportion compensation between the respective interest
holders in the land in a way that is proportionate to the value of their respective
interests.
54 When compensation payable
(1) An applicant is entitled to compensation from an infrastructure manager in the
following circumstances:
(a) in exercising a right under this Act, the infrastructure manager has
materially damaged or destroyed the applicant’s property , or materially
af fected the applicant’s use or enjoyment of the property:
(b) in exercising a right under this Act, the infrastructure manager has, in
ef fect, taken possession of the applicant’s property within the meaning of
Article 40 of the constitution:
(c) the infrastructure manager has infrastructure below land, and the
applicant now wishes to place a permanent structure on that land, but the
infrastructure manager neither—
(i) consents to relocate the infrastructure outside the footprint of the
proposed structure; nor
(ii) consents to the applicant placing the proposed structure over the
infrastructure:
(d) in exercising a right under this Act the infrastructure manager has
damaged or destroyed vegetation, and the damage or destruction—
(i) is to growing crops of commercial value or to plants that yield
crops of commercial value; or
(ii) breaches the terms of any project permit granted under the
Environment Act 2003; or
(iii) breaches the terms of any agreement concerning the infrastructure
or any conditions imposed by the Court:
(e) land has been compulsorily taken from an owner under section 45 or 46.
(2) The Court may take into account any other matters, not inconsistent with this
Act, in determining the amount of compensation.
55 When compensation is discretionary
(1) An applicant is not entitled as of right to compensation in respect of the
following:
(a) damage to property that is repaired by the infrastructure manager within
a reasonable time:
(b) permanent but minimal alteration to the features of land:
s 53LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 821,506

(c) disruption of enjoyment of property where the disruption is reasonable
and temporary:
(d) installation of infrastructure under the surface of the land, if—
(i) the infrastructure is placed at least 200 millimetres below the
surface (other than at places where it rises to the surface to join
with other components of network infrastructure); and
(ii) all manholes, access covers, inspection points, and similar
infrastructure components are installed ﬂush with, or otherwise
landscaped in a way complementary to, the existing surface of the
land;
(e) placement of infrastructure over the land where the owner’s or occupier’s
use and enjoyment of the land is not af fected to any substantial degree,
having regard to generally accepted standards in the Cook Islands:
(f) location of the infrastructure on land where the infrastructure is less than
3 square metres in area and no higher than 1 metre above the ground.
(2) However, the Court may grant compensation if—
(a) any of paragraphs (a) to (f) of subsection (1) apply; and
(b) the Court is satisﬁed that the applicant has suf fered substantial loss or
damage in such circumstances that there are special circumstances
justifying the award of compensation.
