a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or
cause confusion in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of
which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely
to be taken either—
(a) as being use as a trade mark; or
(b) in a case in which the use is use upon the goods or in physical relation

consented to the use of the trade mark; or
(b) in relation to goods adapted to form part of, or to be accessory to, other
goods in relation to which the trade mark has been used without
infringement of the right given as aforesaid or might for the time being be
so used, if the use of the mark is reasonably necessary in order to indicate
that the goods are so adapted and neither the purpose nor the ef fect of the
use of the mark is to indicate otherwise than in accordance with the fact
a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods.
(4) The use of a registered trade mark, being one of two or more registered trade
marks that are identical or nearly resemble each other, in exercise of the right to

registration as aforesaid in Part B of the register, otherwise than by an act that
is deemed to be an infringement by virtue of section 10, no injunction or other
relief shall be granted to the plaintif f if the defendant establishes to the
satisfaction of the Court that the use of which the plaintif f complains is not
likely to deceive or cause confusion or to be taken as indicating a connection in
the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right either
as proprietor or as registered user to use the trade mark.
Compare: 1939 No 26 s 7
10 Infringement by breach of certain restrictions

section applies, any person who, being the owner for the time being of the goods
and having notice of the obligation, does that act, or authorises it to be done, in
relation to the goods, in the course of trade or with a view to any dealing
therewith in the course of trade, shall be deemed thereby to infringe the right to
the use of the trade mark given by the registration thereof, unless that person
became the owner of the goods by purchase for money or money’s worth in
good faith before receiving notice of the obligation or by virtue of a title derived
through another who so became the owner thereof.

other trade mark to the goods:

goods of any other matter in writing that is likely to injure the reputation
of the trade mark.
(3) In this section references in relation to any goods to the proprietor, to a
registered user, and to the registration of a trade mark shall be construed
respectively as references to the proprietor in whose name the trade mark is
registered, to a registered user who is registered, and to the registration of the
trade mark, in respect of those goods; and the expression upon includes in
relation to any goods a reference to physical relation thereto.
Compare: 1939 No 26 s 8

any of his predecessors in business; or

quality of his goods, not being a description that would be likely to be
taken as importing any such reference as is mentioned in section 8(1)(a)
or in section 47(3)(h).

cause, or an entry wrongly remaining on the register, as the circumstances may
require:
Provided that the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not have ef fect in
relation to a word which is used to denote only a brand or make of the element

36 Defensive registration of well-known trade marks
(1) Where a trade mark consisting of an invented word or invented words has
become so well known as respects any goods in respect of which it is registered
and in relation to which it has been used that the use thereof in relation to other
goods would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of
trade between those goods and a person entitled to use the trade mark in relation
to the ﬁrst-mentioned goods, then, notwithstanding that the proprietor registered
in respect of the ﬁrst-mentioned goods does not use or propose to use the trade
mark in relation to those other goods, and notwithstanding anything in
section 35, the trade mark may , on the application in the prescribed manner of
the proprietor registered in respect of the ﬁrst-mentioned goods, be registered in
his name in respect of those other goods as a defensive trade mark, and, while
so registered, shall not be liable to be taken of f the register in respect of those
goods under that section.
(2) The registered proprietor of a trade mark may apply for the registration thereof
in respect of any goods as a defensive trade mark notwithstanding that it is
already registered in his name in respect of those goods otherwise than as a
defensive trade mark, or may apply for the registration thereof in respect of any
goods otherwise than as a defensive trade mark notwithstanding that it is already
registered in his name in respect of those goods as a defensive trade mark,
instead in each case of the existing registration.
(3) A trade mark registered as a defensive trade mark and that trade mark as
otherwise registered in the name of the same proprietor shall, notwithstanding
that the respective registrations are in respect of dif ferent goods, be deemed to
be, and shall be registered as, associated trade marks.
(4) On application by any person aggrieved to the Court or, at the option of the
applicant and subject to the provisions of section 67, to the Commissioner, the
registration of a trade mark as a defensive trade mark may be cancelled on the
ground that the requirements of subsection (1) are no longer satisﬁed in respect
of any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered in the name of the
same proprietor otherwise than as a defensive trade mark, or may be cancelled
as respects any goods in respect of which it is registered as a defensive trade
mark on the ground that there is no longer any likelihood that the use of the
trade mark in relation to those goods would be taken as giving the indication
mentioned in subsection (1).
(5) The Commissioner may at any time cancel the registration as a defensive trade
mark of a trade mark of which there is no longer any registration in the name of
the same proprietor otherwise than as a defensive trade mark.

would not be contrary to the public interest, the Commissioner may register the
proposed registered user as a registered user in respect of the goods as to which
he is so satisﬁed subject as aforesaid.
(6) The Commissioner shall refuse an application under the foregoing provisions of
this section if it appears to him that the grant thereof would tend to facilitate
traf f icking in a trade mark.

that any document produced or information or evidence given for the purposes
of an application under the foregoing provisions of this section (other than
matter entered in the register) is not disclosed to any other person except by

the prescribed manner of the registered proprietor or of the registered

to disclose, some fact material to the application for the
registration, or that the circumstances have materially changed
since the date of the registration:
(iii) that the registration ought not to have been ef fected having regard
to rights vested in the applicant by virtue of a contract in the
performance of which he is interested.
(9) Provision shall be made by regulations under this Act for the notiﬁcation of the
registration of a person as a registered user to any other registered user of the
trade mark, and for the notiﬁcation of an application under subsection (8) to the
registered proprietor and each registered user (not being the applicant) of the
trade mark, and for giving to the applicant on such an application, and to all
persons to whom such an application is notiﬁed and who intervene in the
proceedings in accordance with the regulations, an opportunity of being heard.
