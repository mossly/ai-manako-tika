Supply to consumers
21 Systems
(1) The Authority must supply electricity to the consumers by means of 1 or more

(a) 3-phase 4-wire alternating current system at a normal rated voltage of
415 volts between phases and 240 volts between each phase and the
neutral conductor:
(b) 3 phase 3-wire alternating current system at a normal rated voltage of
415 volts between phases:
(c) 2 wire single phase alternating current system at a normal rated voltage
of 240 volts:
(d) high voltage alternating current 3 phase system:
(e) such other system as may be authorised by the licence.
(2) The system of supply of low voltage alternating current installations must be the
MEN system.
22 Frequency
The frequency at the consumer’s point of supply must be maintained, except for
momentary ﬂuctuations within 2% above or below 50 hertz.
23 V oltage
(1) The voltage at the consumer’s point of supply must be designed, except for
momentary ﬂuctuations within 6% above or below the standard voltage, under
normal load conditions.
(2) In case of a complaint by a consumer regarding voltage at his or her installation
being beyond prescribed limits, the Authority must arrange to record the voltage
for a reasonable period. If the variations are beyond the prescribed limits under
normal load conditions, the Authority must take steps to improve the voltage
conditions to bring them within these limits.
(3) The Authority may require a consumer to make a deposit for the charges to be
incurred in the check of voltage which will be refunded to the consumer in case
the voltage is found to be beyond the prescribed limits.
24 Supply to consumers
(1) A consumer requiring supply of electricity to the consumer’s premises may
request the Authority in writing giving such details as the Authority may require
including the location and extent of the premises.
(2) The Authority must supply electricity to the consumer according to its standard
terms and conditions for the supply of electricity . Special conditions apply to
cases of uneconomic supply as laid down in regulation 27.
(3) The Authority must construct its system for providing electricity to the
consumer, consistent with its current practice, in a manner that will result in
minimum total cost to the consumer. If more than one consumer is to be
supplied electricity through the same system, the system will be constructed in
a manner so as to balance, as far as possible, the total cost to each consumer.
Service 0635,801

(4) The consumer must bear the cost of the installation of all service mains within
the customer’s premises.
(5) The Authority must share or apportion equitably among the consumers the cost
of a distribution main erected by it.
(6) The Authority may set any requirements in terms of these regulations for the
installation and utilisation of distribution mains and service mains to ensure the
safe and adequate supply of electricity to the consumer.
(7) Before giving supply to any premises, the Authority must satisfy itself that the
Electrical Inspector has checked all electricity supply lines, plant and equipment
on a consumer’s premises up to the point of supply and that they are in a safe
condition and in all respects ﬁt to receive a supply of electricity .
(8) The Authority must, when it is aware that a service main or part thereof is
unsatisfactory , inadequate or unreliable, advise the consumer who must engage
a competent person to carry out any work required to remedy the defect and the
consumer must bear the cost.
(9) The Authority must, when it is aware that a distribution main or part thereof is
unsatisfactory , inadequate or unreliable, advise the consumers supplied by
means of that line who must engage a competent person to carry out any work
required to remedy the defect. Provided that where the work is not completed to
the satisfaction of the Authority , it must undertake the remedial work and is
entitled to equitably apportion cost among the af fected consumers.
(10) A consumer must provide and maintain in an acceptable condition, without cost
to the Authority , suf f icient suitable space on the consumer’s premises to enable
the Authority to install any substation, lines, or equipment necessary solely to
give the consumer a satisfactory supply . In the event that this space, or an
extension of space is required for a substation, lines or equipment which will
also supply other consumers or premises, the provision of such space must be on
terms to be agreed between the Authority and the consumer. Provided that
nothing in this subclause prevents the Authority from taking land or acquiring
any easement, lease or licence under the law .
(11) Where a consumer demands a supply with enhanced electrical characteristics or
enhanced reliability and the Authority provides an enhancement of electrical
characteristics of the whole or part of the supply system substantially beyond
that which would be provided in accordance with current practice of the
Authority for a consumer in similar circumstances without such requirement,
the Authority may recover from the consumer additional costs incurred in
providing lines or equipment to satisfy these requirements.
25 Right of supply
(1) Every consumer within any part of the Authority’s area of supply is entitled to
a supply of electricity on the same terms and conditions as those on which any
other consumer within that part of the area is receiving in similar circumstances
a corresponding supply . Provided that where the electricity distribution
economics are signiﬁcantly dif ferent for the area in which the consumer is
located, the Minister may authorise the Authority to specify such dif ferent terms
and conditions for consumers within the af fected area as the Minister thinks ﬁt.
(2) The Authority must prepare standard terms and conditions, including a tarif f
schedule, under which a supply of electricity will be made available to the
consumer and a copy must be made available to any consumer on request.
reg 24LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 635,802

(3) The terms and conditions and any amendment thereto and tarif f schedule must
be deposited with the Minister when issued.
26 Under-utilised capital assets
Where an Authority has provided a capital investment in electricity distribution
assets and the consumer’s electricity consumption has failed consistently to
achieve the forecast level of consumption for which the consumer had requested
supply and a lesser level of investment would have been satisfactory for the
installation, the Authority may require the consumer to contribute towards the
cost of the investment in the under-utilised capital assets.
27 Standard conditions relating to uneconomic supply
(1) In this regulation, unless the context otherwise requires—
(a) extension means any addition or alteration to the supply system of the
Authority necessary to give satisfactory supply to the consumer; and
(b) the capital cost of an extension is total construction cost of the extension;
and
(c) the allocated capital cost of an extension is the capital cost of the
extension less—
(i) the portion of that capital cost allocated for the supply to other
consumers in the case of a line which is or may be jointly used to
supply other consumers; and
(ii) the portion of that capital cost allocated for progressive supply
system development.
(d) the serviced capital cost in relation to an extension is the maximum
capital cost for which the estimated annual revenue from the consumer
will allow an adequate return to the Authority calculated in accordance
with the following formula:
C x P x F
Where:
C is the average annual electricity consumption in the same general
class of consumers as the consumer to be supplied:
P is the revenue per kilowatt-hour accruing to the Authority from
electricity supplied to a consumer in the same general class as the
consumer to be supplied:
F is a factor with deﬁned numerical values to be applied to dif fering
extension and consumption situations as determined by the Minister
and published from time to time taking into account an appropriate
economic rate of return on electricity distribution assets.
(e) the chargeable capital cost of any extension is the allocated capital cost of
the extension less the serviced capital cost in relation to the extension;
and
(f) the term uneconomic supply, in relation to the extension means a supply
where the serviced capital cost of the extension is less than the allocated
capital cost.
