Principle of protection, conservation, and restoration

(i) protected, and their biodiversity conserved, for their cultural and
natural heritage value; and
(ii) shared by all Cook Islanders:
Principle of sustainable use to maximise beneﬁts

resources should be used to maximise beneﬁts, while meeting key
environmental objectives to beneﬁt current and future generations of
Cook Islanders:
Precautionary principle
(c) the precautionary principle is that the precautionary principle of the Rio
Declaration should be applied where there are threats of serious or
irreversible damage, and that a lack of full scientiﬁc certainty should not
be used as a reason for postponing cost ef fective measures to prevent
environmental degradation in accordance with the Cook Islands’
capabilities in the implementation of the marae moana:
Principle of community participation
(d) the principle of community participation is that all stakeholders should
participate in the planning and implementation processes, which means
that information exchange, consultation, respect for dif fering points of
view , recognition of culture and traditions, equitable access to
opportunities for present and future generations, easily understood and
openly justiﬁed processes, and the shared ownership of responsibility
should be promoted and encouraged in the decision-making processes of
the marae moana:
Principle of transparency and accountability
(e) the principle of transparency and accountability is that the processes for
assessing, planning, allocating, managing, and evaluating management of
ocean resources should provide transparent and clear lines of
accountability:
s 4LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 330,304

Principle of integrated management
(f) the principle of integrated management is that the integration of decision
making across all relevant stakeholders (Government, non-government,
and external partners) should be pursued in decisions af fecting the
operation of this Act:
Principle of investigation and research
(g) the principle of investigation and research is that a culture of
investigation and research as a basis of discussion and decision-making
should be fostered, and that ocean planning and management decisions
should be based on the best available scientiﬁc and other information,
recognising that current information regarding ocean resources may be
limited:
Principle of ecosystem-based management
(h) the principle of ecosystem-based management is that there should be an
ecosystem-based approach to the management of natural resources that
aims to sustain the health, resilience, and diversity of ecosystems of
species, while allowing for sustainable use by humans of the goods and
services they provide:
Principle of sustainable ﬁnancing
(i) the principle of sustainable ﬁnancing is that adequate funding for
activities implemented for the marae moana should be pursued to achieve
desired outcomes.
