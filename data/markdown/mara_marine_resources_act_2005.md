The Boneﬁsh Sport Fishery
Art cl 22 MARINE RESOURCES (AITUT AKI AND MANUAE BONEFISH FISHERY)
Service 0398,401

The Boneﬁsh Sport Fishery
Boneﬁsh sport ﬁshing is established in many destinations in the tropical regions such as, the
Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, Africa, South America and in the United States of America The
Paciﬁc region is able to attract sport anglers from all over the world in pursuit for new ﬁshing
sites and challenges.
In countries such as Cuba, Seychelles Islands, Mexico and the Bahamas, tourism has developed
around ﬁshing for this species. T ourism brings in foreign currency and creates income
opportunities for the communities concerned, including direct employment for local ﬁshing
guides. In the Paciﬁc Islands, ﬂy-ﬁshing for boneﬁsh is practiced commercially in New
Caledonia and on Christmas Island (Kiribati). On Christmas Island, with about 1,000 visiting
ﬂy-ﬁshers a year, this tourist based ﬁshery excluding side beneﬁts to the community is valued at
a minimum of USD2.5 million.
Specialist boneﬁsh enthusiasts are today seeking new destinations of fering promising
opportunities to locate and engage in catching many good-sized specimens. An ‘exotic’ natural
environment, high-quality tourism infrastructure and regular international transport links are
essential for the development of a boneﬁsh sports ﬁshery . Aitutaki meets these criteria There is a
unanimous desire on the part of local government, hoteliers and community to develop sport
ﬁshing and tourism around the boneﬁsh resource.
Status of the Aitutaki Fishery
There are 2 known boneﬁsh species in the Paciﬁc, these include the more common and
widespread species, Albula glossodonta and the less common A. forsteri . These 2 boneﬁsh
species tend to occupy similar habitats, occurring in shallow sandy areas of lagoons of a number
of Paciﬁc countries, where they feed on shrimps, small bivalve molluscs and small crabs.
Boneﬁsh was an important traditional food source for the Aitutaki community . Historically ,
ﬁshers caught boneﬁsh with hook and line, and handmade ﬁbre nets. Catches on each trip were
less than 100 pieces but with the modem introduction of motorised boats and monoﬁlament
gillnets, ﬁshers were able to increase their catches to over 1,000 ﬁsh per trip.
Anecdotal reports describe how in 1978 ﬁshermen, using gillnets, surrounded and caught
boneﬁsh in a spawning aggregation that formed to the west of Rapota It is estimated that a total
of 3,600 ﬁsh weighing 6 tonnes were caught in a single set.
The only existing record of boneﬁsh abundance data was that of Whitford & Guinea in 1993
who reported densities of 88.9 and 30.0 ﬁsh/km
2 at Rapota and T apuaetai islets, respectively .
They believe that once abundant stocks were being reduced signiﬁcantly through over ﬁshing
with gillnets.

Schedule 8
Code of Conduct for Boneﬁsh Anglers
1. Always use barbless hooks.
2. T ackle should match conditions and the size of the ﬁsh so ﬁsh can be landed quickly .
3. Always try and land a boneﬁsh before it gets exhausted and cannot swim.
4. Always try and shorten the ﬁght time.
5. If a boneﬁsh have lost the ability to swim after landing, revive it until it can swim
upright.
6. Try and avoid holding or touching the boneﬁsh with bare hands. If you need to handle
a ﬁsh non-abrasive gloves should be used.
7. In removing a hook, use haemostats or pliers while keeping the ﬁsh in the water and
a quick release is encouraged given that time to remove the hook can af fect survival
of the ﬁsh.
8. A void exposing boneﬁsh to air. If you need to hold ﬁsh in the air then exposure should
not exceed a maximum of 15 seconds.
9. A void touching the gills of the ﬁsh.
10. If you need to weigh the ﬁsh, use a weighing cradle and avoid lip-gripping weighing
devices.
11. Be wary of predators when releasing boneﬁsh, the chances of a released boneﬁsh
being caught by a predator is high. If predators become attracted to your ﬁshing
activity , move to another ﬁshing location.
12. For your own safety , do not go out alone to ﬁsh on the ﬂats in the lagoon without a
registered boneﬁsh guide. Note that there are designated sand ﬂat areas where you
may ﬁsh alone if you wish.
13. Act green and keep Aitutaki and Manuae lagoon clean! Do not dispose any of your
rubbish into the lagoon environment. Always take your rubbish back with you and
dispose in an appropriate place.
14. The taking of any scientiﬁc specimen (living or non-living) from the natural
environment is prohibited unless a prior Research Permit has been granted by the
National Research Committee issued by the Of f ice of the Prime Minister.
15. Please respect the local culture and traditions.
16. Any mistreatment by boneﬁsh guides or other local residents should be reported to the
Aitutaki Island Council as soon as possible.
17. It is recommended that 4 stroke outboard motors be used rather than 2 stroke
outboards.
These regulations are administered by the Ministry of Marine Resources.

Purse Seine Fishery Plan (2013)
Part 1
Preliminary information
1 Title
The title of this plan is the Skipjack Tuna Purse Seine Fishery Plan (2013), there
after referred to as Fishery Plan .
2 Application
(1) The Fishery Plan has been prepared in accordance with section 6 of the Marine
Resources Act 2005. The Skipjack Tuna Purse Seine Fishery is hereby declared
to be a designated ﬁshery in terms of section 6.
(2) All activities carried out under this Fishery Plan are subject to the applicable
provisions of all Acts and regulations of Cook Islands.
(3) The Fishery Plan applies to all purse seine ﬁshing for skipjack tuna
(Katsuwonus pelamis).
(4) The Fishery Plan shall enter into force by Order in Executive Council.
3 Purpose
The purpose of the Fishery Plan is to provide ecologically sustainable
development and establish an ef fective, beneﬁcial and enforceable management
structure for the purse seine ﬁshery .
4 Deﬁnitions
The terms in this Fishery Plan have the meanings ascribed to them in the Marine
Resources Act 2005 unless the context provides otherwise or as otherwise set
out in this section.
Act means the Marine Resources Act 2005
bycatch species means non-target, dependent or associated species of the target
species
commercial ﬁshing means taking ﬁsh for sale
conservation and management measures means measures to conserve and
manage 1 or more species of living marine resources in accordance with the
objectives of this Fishery Plan and the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Act
Fishery Plan means the Purse Seine Fishery Plan prepared by the Secretary in
accordance with section 6
purse seine ﬁshing means ﬁshing using a surrounding net which utilises a purse
line at the bottom of the net
purse seine ﬁshery means commercial ﬁshing targeting the skipjack tuna
(Katsuwonus pelamis) .
Service 0410,001

5 T arget species and area of application
(a) For the purposes of this Fishery Plan, the skipjack tuna purse seine
ﬁshery is deﬁned to encompass all purse seine ﬁshing activities involved
in the catching of tuna species from the ﬁshery waters of the Cook
Islands other than those exempted under the Marine Resources (Purse
Seine Fishing) Regulations 2013.
(b) Purse seine ﬁshing for tuna in the Paciﬁc Islands region targets skipjack,
and to a lesser degree yellow tin tuna, very largely for canning, although
more recently some purse seiners have been ﬁtted to deliver higher
quality tuna also, especially yellow ﬁn. Purse seine ﬁshing has become
the increasingly dominant form of ﬁshing method being used in the
region, and now takes approximately 95% of tuna catches in Paciﬁc
Island Countries’ waters, largely because of increased economic
ef f iciency , including lower relative fuel costs when compared with long
lining.
(c) The Cook Islands purse seine ﬁshery and status is summaries in Annex 1.
[The next page is 410,401]

Part 2
Strategies
6 Fisheries management objectives
The primary management objectives of this ﬁshery plan are:
(a) to provide for the sustainable use of large pelagic ﬁsh resources for the
beneﬁt of the people of the Cook Islands; and
(b) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the purse seine ﬁshery; and
(c) to mitigate the impact of ﬁshing on non-target species; and
(d) to develop and maintain the economic viability of the purse seine ﬁshery
and associated ﬁshing industry , including the development of the Cook
Islands domestic ﬂeet and onshore processing in the Cook Islands; and
(e) to ensure that Cook Islands meets its international environmental and
ﬁsheries obligations; and
(f) to strengthen the exercise of Cook Islands sovereign rights and ensure
that its special requirements as a small island developing states are
appropriately taken into account in regional tuna management, and
position Cook Islands for equitable participation in the regional tuna
ﬁsheries; and
(g) to protect traditional and small scale commercial inshore ﬁshers; and
(h) to protect the integrity of government revenue; and
(i) to fulﬁl the purposes and principles in the Act.
7 Principal ways to achieve the objectives
The measures applied to achieve the objectives of the Fishery Plan include the
following:
(a) establish licensing arrangements that encourage ﬁshing operations to
provide greater beneﬁts to Cook Islands, particularly through the landing,
value adding and processing of ﬁsh in Cook Islands:
(b) limit the size of the purse seine ﬂeet in the ﬁshery waters to avoid local
depletion particularly of skipjack tuna and yellow ﬁn tuna:
(c) require the use of ﬁshing gear and methods that reduce the impacts of
ﬁshing on non-target species:
(d) monitor ﬁshing operations and catches, particularly through vessel
monitoring systems, onboard observers and port sampling:
(e) collect other scientiﬁc and ﬁsheries information on the purse seine
ﬁshery , including collection and analysis of daily catch and ef fort
information:
(f) combat IUU ﬁshing and ensure compliance with laws, regulations,
licence conditions and provisions of the Fishery Plan:
(g) implement relevant measures of the WCPF Commission and the relevant
provisions of the WCPF Convention and other relevant international
ﬁsheries and environmental instruments.
8 Potential beneﬁts of the ﬁshery
Potential beneﬁts from the development of this ﬁshery include:
(a) revenue from licensing, with the prospect that the value of licensing
revenue from purse seining could equal and surpass that currently
received from the long line ﬂeet:
Art cl 6 MARINE RESOURCES (PURSE SEINE FISHERY) REGULA TIONS 2013
Service 0410,401

(b) potential for broader Cook Islands participation and broader economic
beneﬁts from increased ﬁshing operations in the northern Cook Islands,
including beneﬁts from servicing and monitoring of vessel operations:
(c) establishment of a basis for long term rights for Cook Islands in purse
seine ﬁshing within the emerging regional arrangements for tuna
conservation and management:
(d) improved control of a ﬁshery known to operate around the most remote
area of the Cook Islands EEZ.

Art cl 6LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 410,402

Part 3
Conservation and management considerations
9 Appropriate scale and extent of the ﬁshery
(a) Despite a long period of access for the US ﬂeet, there are only sporadic
results and one comprehensive year of catch history to fully understand
the likely catch rates and catch values of the domestic purse seine ﬁshery .
(b) Stock assessment conducted by the oceanography division of the French
Space Agency (CSL) suggest that biomass of skipjack tuna in the Cook
Islands waters is 189,000 tonnes and ﬁshing ef fort of 30,000 tonnes will
not signiﬁcant reduce spawning biomass below the 40% reference point
commonly utilized in ﬁsheries management.
10 Impacts and interactions
(a) The impact on tuna stocks. While there no substantial concerns about the
risk of overﬁshing of the skipjack stock which is expected to make up the
bulk of the purse seine catch in Cook Islands waters, there are concerns
about the status of yellow ﬁn tuna, and particularly big eye tuna, which
will also be caught in the purse seine ﬁshery .
(b) The relatively high catch rates of juvenile big eye tuna in waters north
east of the Northern Cook Islands. The big eye tuna bycatch rates from
sets on ﬂoating objects/F ADs are known to be moderately high in waters
adjacent to the Cook Islands EEZ in the north-east, but there is little
information available on big eye tuna by catches in Cook Islands waters.
If these are less than bycatches to the north and east then ﬁshing in Cook
Islands waters could provide an alternative ﬁshing ground that would
reduce impacts on juvenile big eye compared with where the ﬂeet now
operates.
(c) The impact on non-target species, particularly whale sharks, sharks and
sea turtles. No information is available on the impact of this ﬁshing on
non-target species in Cook Islands waters.
(d) The impact on the long line ﬁshery . Since the existing long line ﬁshery
targets mainly albacore, and the purse seine ﬁshery targets mainly
skipjack, the interactions between the 2 ﬁsheries will be more limited
than if they were both targeting the same stock. However, yellow ﬁn is an
important secondary target stock for both the long line and purse seine
ﬁsheries, and a single purse seiner can catch as much yellow ﬁn tuna as
the existing ﬂeet of around long liners. T o a lesser degree, the same likely
to be true of big eye tuna.
11 Monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS)
(a) An observer programme must be established to achieve the level of
observer coverage in the purse seine ﬁshery that the Secretary is satisﬁed
is appropriate to meet the objectives of the Act and this Fishery Plan, and
which is consistent with any applicable regional and international
standards and obligations. This may include participation in regional
programmes, where appropriate.
(b) The Secretary must establish a MCS program programme that assists in
meeting the conservation and management objectives of this Fishery Plan
and all relevant international and regional obligations. Such a programme
may include—
Art cl 9MARINE RESOURCES (PURSE SEINE FISHERY) REGULA TIONS 2013
Service 0410,810

(i) vessel monitoring systems:
(ii) the provision of observers and the conditions under which they
operate:
(iii) a vessel inspection regime:
(iv) a port and catch inspection regime:
(v) the prohibition or regulation of transhipment at sea or in port:
(vi) aerial and sea surveillance:
(vii) participation in co-operative regional arrangements.
(c) Applying limits to ﬁshing ef fort in ﬁshing days will require MMR to
closely monitor ﬁshing days by V essel Monitoring System (VMS) and
observer coverage.
(d) During periods of the F AD closure measures there shall be no manual
VMS reporting, 100% observer coverage and poling frequency of VMS
to increase.
(e) Associated with conservation and management measures applying to
purse seining in the W estern Central Paciﬁc are a range of international
obligations which are outlined below .
12 International obligations
(a) The Cook Islands applies the key principles and obligations in
international law relating to of fshore ﬁsheries, including the application
of the precautionary approach, through the Marine Resources Act. In
addition, Cook Islands cooperates with other states to ensure the ef fective
conservation and management of shared tuna stocks through the W estern
and Central Paciﬁc Fisheries Commission (the WCPFC).
(b) The WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure CMM 2008–01
sets out a range of requirements for control of purse seining between 20N
and 20S. This measure was temporarily extended by CMM 2012–01 with
additional interim measures, which the Cook Islands will apply in its
waters, including:
(i) a 3-month ban on setting on ﬂoating objects from July to
September; and
(ii) additional reduction of F AD sets by electing to 1 month F AD
closure in October, or annual limit of F AD sets to 8/12 of the
average F AD sets of the 3 years average from 2009–2011; and
(iii) a ban on discards of all big eye, skipjack and yellow ﬁn tuna —
referred to as the catch retention scheme; and
(iv) 100% observer coverage except for trips wholly in Cook Islands
waters.
(c) There are a range of other WCPFC measures applying to purse seine
ﬁshing between 20N and 20S including monitoring, control and
surveillance measures, and measures to mitigate the impact of ﬁshing on
non-target species.
(d) More broadly , if the domestic purse seine ﬁshery is conducted in
accordance with applicable WCPFC measures, it should assist the Cook
Islands to secure an equitable outcome from regional conservation and

Appendix 1
Status of the Cook Islands Purse Seine Fishery
1. Purse seine ﬁshing in the W estern and Central Paciﬁc region has been heavily
concentrated in the west from Papua New Guinea across to the Gilbert Islands and within
5 degrees either side of the equator as shown in the ﬁgure below of the distribution of
purse seine catches for the period 2001–9 by 1 degree squares.
2. Purse seine ﬁshing in Cook Islands waters has historically been regarded as viable only
in occasional periods of favourable oceanographic conditions because purse seine catch
rates are generally higher elsewhere in the region. However, the regional purse seine
ﬁsheries are undergoing substantial structural change driven by a mix of biological and
economic factors.
3. Licensed purse seine ﬁshing in Cook Islands’ waters in past years has been limited to
ﬁshing by US vessels authorised under the Multilateral Treaty with the US. Purse seine
catches in Cook Islands waters make up around 0.3% of the regional purse seine catch.
4. Purse seine ﬁshing in the Cook Islands EEZ has generally been at low levels with only
2 periods of “signiﬁcant” ﬁshing ef fort of more than 100 sets in a year. It is generally
thought that the Cook Islands EEZ is located east and south of the main ﬁshing grounds.
Estimated purse seine catches in Cook Islands waters are shown in the table below .
5. The greatest level of ef fort occurred during the most recent year and log sheet and VMS
data suggest that over 400 sets have been made with catches of more than 10,000 mt. It
is not clear if this reﬂects a particular set of oceanographic conditions which has made
ﬁshing favourable in Cook Islands waters, or reﬂects changes in ﬁshing patterns by some
ﬂeets to target ﬁsh that have always existed.
6. When all data is combined, associated (F AD) sets slightly outnumber unassociated or free
school sets with 54% of sets on associated schools. However, when catches are
considered, 68% of catch comes from associated sets and this is reﬂected in the
considerably higher catch per set for associated sets.
7. Recent results from the SEAPODYM model (developed by SPC in conjunction with
Collected Localisation Satellites (CLS)) for skipjack suggests that a signiﬁcant biomass
of skipjack exists in the northern part of the Cook Islands EEZ. While these results are
preliminary and have not been fully validated, the recent ﬁshing activity is not
inconsistent with the predictions from SEAPODYM that skipjack exist in ﬁshable
densities in Cook Islands waters.

8. Currently , the only signiﬁcant commercial beneﬁt that Cook Islands receives from the
regional skipjack resources which it shares, and the regional purse seine ﬁshery based on
the skipjack resource, is from the treaty with the US from which Cook Islands.
9. A number of factors indicate the possibility of a sustainable, beneﬁcial purse seine ﬁshery
within Cook Islands waters, and opportunities for the sustainable development of a small
Cook Islands purse seine ﬂeet operating substantially in the Cook Islands EEZ and the
adjacent high seas areas. These factors include:
a) increased exploitation and tighter limits on purse seining in the main ﬁshing
grounds along the equator causing purse seine operators to look for other ﬁshing
grounds:
b) the general tightening of access to the regional purse seine ﬁshery also
encouraging purse seine operators to work more closely with resource-owning
Paciﬁc Island countries, including transferring their vessels to Paciﬁc Island
Art cl 22 MARINE RESOURCES (PURSE SEINE FISHERY) REGULA TIONS 2013
Service 0412,803

Countries registry/ﬂagging. This includes both existing operators who are keen
to have secure access in future, and new operators who may be excluded if they
don’t enter into association with a resource-owning Paciﬁc Island country now:
c) an increase in purse seine operations in the Central Paciﬁc resulting from
developments such as those in Pago Pago and increased interest for tuna
supplies from processing industries in the east, especially Ecuador:
d) increased interest expressed by foreign processors and purse seine operators in
purse seine ﬁshing in Cook Islands waters and adjacent high seas areas.

Fishery Plan
Large Pelagic Longline Fishery Plan (2016)
Part 1
Preliminary information
1 Title
The title of this Plan is the Large Pelagic Longline Fishery Plan (Fishery Plan).
2 Application
(1) The Fishery Plan has been prepared in accordance with section 6(2) of the
Marine Resources Act 2005 (Act) and the Marine Resources (Large Pelagic
Longline Fishery and Quota Management System) Regulations 2016
(Regulations). The Fishery is hereby declared to be a Designated Fishery under
section 6(1) of the Act.
(2) All activities carried out under this Fishery Plan will be subject to the applicable
provisions of all Acts and Regulations of the Cook Islands.
(3) The area of application of the Fishery Plan is the same as the Regulations.
3 Purpose
(1) The purpose of this Plan is to provide ef fective management of the large pelagic
longline ﬁshery in the Cook Islands waters in order to ensure sustainable
development of the ﬁshery .
(2) This Plan also establishes a quota management system for the pelagic longline
ﬁshery in accordance with the Act and the Regulations.
4 Deﬁnitions
(1) All terms and deﬁnitions in this Plan have the same meaning as in the Act and
in the Regulations.
(2) Quota means an allocation of a right to harvest a certain amount of ﬁsh within
a single speciﬁed ﬁshing period.

Part 2
Quota Management System (QMS)
5 T una stocks subject to QMS under this Fishery Plan
(1) Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga)
(a) Albacore tuna consists of a single stock in the South Paciﬁc, distributed
south of the equator and spawning in tropical and subtropical latitudes.
Juveniles are caught in surface ﬁsheries around New Zealand in the
higher latitudes, while adults are taken in the tropical and subtropical
waters in the longline ﬁshery . Large distant water ﬂeets and the domestic
ﬂeets of Paciﬁc Island countries catch a large proportion of adult albacore
across their geographic range with strong seasonal trends. The longline
ﬁshery operates in the southern latitudes in the late summer, moving
north during the winter. This trend is evident in the Cook Islands with a
very strong seasonal longline trend and increased catch rates from around
March/April through to September/October.
(b) The most recent stock assessment on South Paciﬁc Albacore was
conducted in 2015 by the Paciﬁc Community’s Oceanic Fisheries
Program (OFP) and concluded that overﬁshing is not occurring and the
stock is currently not overﬁshed. The current spawning biomass is above
the adopted limit reference point of 20% unﬁshed spawning biomass and
is at approximately 43% of its unﬁnished levels.
(c) The Cook Islands tuna ﬁshery has typically consisted of longline vessels
targeting South Paciﬁc Albacore servicing the canneries of Pago Pago
and Apia. A small domestic fresh ﬁsh ﬂeet operates out of Rarotonga,
supplying the local market and some foreign exports.
(d) The Cook Islands historic peak catch of albacore was 8,800mt and was
attributed largely to the 17 longline bigeye and swordﬁsh exploratory
programmes which operated in 2012. The total catch of albacore from
longlining within the Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in
2015 was 3,271 metric tonnes. The 2015 W estern Central Paciﬁc
Fisheries Convention Area (WCPF-CA) catch of South Paciﬁc albacore
was 68,594mt.
(2) Bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus)
(a) Bigeye tuna are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters
of the Paciﬁc Ocean. They are relatively fast growing reaching a
maximum size of about 200 cm, and begin to mature at around half that
size at around 3 years of age. Bigeye tuna are caught in both the purse
seine ﬁsheries, mostly as juveniles as well as the longline ﬁsheries as
valuable adult ﬁsh.
(b) The most recent stock assessment on bigeye tuna was conducted in 2014
by the Paciﬁc Community’s OFP and concluded that bigeye tuna is
currently overﬁshed and overﬁshing is occurring. Recent levels of
spawning biomass (16%) are most likely below the limit reference point
of 20% unﬁshed spawning biomass. This means that ﬁsh are being
removed at a rate faster than what could maintain the stock and that the
amount of ﬁsh left in the water is less than the limit that has been agreed
upon.
(c) Bigeye tuna is a key tuna species taken in both the Cook Islands longline
and purse seine ﬁsheries. The total catch of bigeye in the Cook Islands in
Art cl 5 MARINE RESOURCES (LPLF AQMS) REGULA TIONS 2016
Service 0415,601

2015 was 517mt in the longline ﬁshery and 96mt in the purse seine
ﬁshery . The W estern Central Paciﬁc Fisheries Convention Area
(WCPF-CA) catch of bigeye was 134,084mt which comprises 5% of the
total WCPF-CA tuna catch. Approximately 48,700mt of bigeye was taken
in the purse seine ﬁshery and 64,000mt in the longline ﬁshery .
6 The management area and ﬁshing period for the QMS
(1) The management area for the QMS includes all the Cook Islands territorial
waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
(2) Under the QMS, the duration for a ﬁshing period and licensing period is
separated on an annual basis according to the calendar year beginning on
1 January and ending on 31 December.
7 Limits on QMS stock
(1) The annual total allowable catch (T AC) and total allowable commercial catch
(T ACC) for commercial longline ﬁshing of albacore and bigeye must be
established under this Fishery Plan.
(2) The T AC and T ACC limits for an annual ﬁshing period may be revised 3 months
prior to the start of the ﬁshing period date, ie, before 30 September.
(3) The initial limits are:
(a) Albacore T AC: 9,750 mt
(b) Albacore T ACC: 9,698 mt
(c) Bigeye T AC: 3,500 mt
(d) Bigeye T ACC: 2,500 mt
8 Minimum quota mix
(1) In order to be issued with a ﬁshing license under this Plan a minimum quota
holding must be purchased as follows:
(a) Albacore minimum quota: 25 mt
(b) Bigeye minimum quota: 20 mt
9 Purchase of QMS quota
(1) Up to 80% of the QMS stock quota may be purchased by licence holders in the
period from October to December of the preceding calendar year.
(2) The price of quota shall be initially set at a ﬁxed amount and may be amended
from time to time, as notiﬁed in writing by the Secretary . The price in New
Zealand dollars is as follows:
(a) Albacore quota: $250 per mt
(b) Bigeye quota: $250 per mt
(3) Fishing vessels that are locally based will be exempted from purchasing the
minimum quota mix.
(4) Quota may only be purchased for a single calendar year, being 1 January to
31 December.
