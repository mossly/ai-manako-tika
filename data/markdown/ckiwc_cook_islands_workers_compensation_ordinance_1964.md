and permanent incapacity of a worker shall be deemed to arise out of and in the

s 9LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 300,406

(3) For the purpose of calculating the earnings of the worker in a claim for
compensation under this section, the commencement of the incapacity of the
worker, or the date of his death if there has been no previous period of
incapacity , shall be treated as the date of the happening of the accident if he is
then employed in any employment to the nature of which the disease is due, by
the employer from whom the compensation is claimed and if he is not then so
employed, the last day on which he was so employed shall for this purpose be
treated as the date of the happening of the accident.
(4) For all the other purposes of this Ordinance the commencement of the
incapacity of the worker, or the date of his death if there has been no previous
period of incapacity , shall be treated as the date of the happening of the accident.
(5) If the disease has been contracted by a gradual process, so that 2 or more
employers are severally liable to pay compensation in respect thereof under this
section, the aggregate amount of compensation recoverable shall not exceed the
amount that would have been recoverable if those employers had been a single
employer, and in any such case those employers shall, in default of agreement,

thinks just, having regard to the circumstances of the case, in any action brought
or application made by any of them for this purpose.

11 Method of calculating earnings
(1) For the purpose of this Ordinance the weekly earnings of a worker shall be
computed in such manner as is best calculated to give the rate per week at which
the worker was being remunerated during the previous 12 months, if he has been
so long employed by the same employer, but, if not, then for any less period
during which he has been in the employment of the same employer:
Provided that where by reason of the shortness of the time during which the
worker has been in the employment of his employer or casual nature of the
employment, or the terms of the employment, it is impracticable at the date of
the accident to compute the rate of remuneration, regard may be had to the
average weekly amount which, during the 12 months previous to the accident,
was being earned by a person of similar earning capacity in the same grade
employed at the same work by the same employer, or, if there is no person so
employed, by a person of similar earning capacity in the same grade employed
in the same class of employment and in the same district:
Provided further that for the purposes of computing the weekly earnings of a
casual worker employed as a stevedoring labourer, such worker shall be deemed
to have been employed for not less than 2 full working shifts per week at the
usual rate of pay for the work upon which he was employed at the time of the
accident.
(2) For the purposes of the preceding subsection, employment by the same
employer shall be taken to mean employment by the same employer in the grade
in which the worker was employed at the time of the accident, uninterrupted by
absence from work due to illness of any other unavoidable cause.
(3) Where the worker had entered into concurrent contracts of service with 2 or
more employers under which he worked at one time for one such employer and
at another time for another such employer, his weekly earnings shall be
computed as if his earnings under all such contracts were earnings in the
employment of the employer for whom he was working at the time of the
accident.
Provided that the earnings of the worker under the concurrent contracts shall be
taken into account only so far as the worker is incapacitated from performing
the concurrent contract.
(4) Upon request of the worker to the employer liable to pay compensation, that
employer shall furnish in writing a list of the earnings which have been earned
by that worker upon which the amount of the weekly earnings may be calculated
for the purposes of this section, or if owing to the casual nature or the terms of
the employment it is impracticable to furnish a list of the earnings of that
particular worker, the employer shall furnish in writing the average weekly
amount which, during the 12 months previous to the accident was being earned
by a person of similar earning capacity in the same grade employed at the same
work by the same employer, or, if there is not person so employed, by a person
of similar earning capacity in the same grade employed in the same class of
employment and in the same district.
(5) When a worker is at the time of the accident under the age of 21 years, or is an
apprentice or learner, and this incapacity , whether total or partial, is permanent,
his weekly earnings at the time of the accident shall be deemed to be the weekly
sum which he would probably have been able to earn if he had then attained the
s 11 COOK ISLANDS WORKERS COMPENSA TION ORDINANCE 1964
Service 0300,901

age of 21 years or had completed his apprenticeship, or had ceased to be learner,
as the case may be, being in no case less than 3 pounds 10 shillings per week:
Provided that nothing in this subsection shall extend to the compensation
payable on the death of a worker.
12 Persons entitled to compensation
(1) The compensation shall be payable to or for the beneﬁt of the worker, or, where
death results from the injury , to or for the beneﬁt of his dependents as provided
by this Ordinance.
(2) Where there are both total and partial dependents nothing in this Ordinance shall
be construed as preventing the compensation being allotted partly to the total
and partly to the partial dependents.
(3) Where a dependent dies before a claim in respect of death is made under this
Ordinance, or if a claim has been made, before an order for the payment of
compensation has been made, the legal personal representative of the dependent
shall have no right to payment of compensation and the claim for compensation
shall be dealt with as if that dependent has died before the worker.
13 Distribution of compensation
(1) Compensation payable where the death of a worker has resulted from an injury
shall be paid to the Court, and the Court may order any sum so paid in to be
apportioned among the dependants of the deceased worker or any of them in
such proportion as the Court thinks ﬁt, or, in the discretion of the Court, to be
allotted to any one such dependent, and the sum so allotted to any dependent
shall be paid to him or be invested, applied, or otherwise dealt with for his
beneﬁt in such manner as the Court thinks ﬁt.
(2) Where, on application being made in accordance with rules made under this
Ordinance, it appears to the Court that, on account of the variation of the
circumstances of the various dependents, or of any other suf f icient cause, an
order made under this subsection ought to be varied, the Court may make such
order as to the apportionment for the variation of the former order as in the
circumstances of the case the Court may think just.
(3) Compensation payable under the provisions of section 7 or 8 and lump sums
payable under the provisions of section 9 or 10 shall be paid to the Court, and
any sums so paid shall be paid to the person entitled thereto or be invested,
applied, or otherwise dealt with for his beneﬁt in such manner as the Court
thinks ﬁt.
(4) Any other compensation payable under this Ordinance may be paid to the
worker or to the Court and when paid to the Court shall be paid by the Court to
the person entitled thereto.
(5) The receipt of the Registrar of the Court shall be a suf f icient discharge in respect
of any amount paid to the Court under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(6) Any order or direction of the Court under this section shall be ﬁnal and binding
on the dependents of the deceased worker.
14 Requirements as to notice of accident and application for compensation
(1) Proceedings for the recovery under this Ordinance of compensation for an injury
shall not be maintainable unless notice of the accident has been given by or on
behalf of the worker as soon as practicable after the happening thereof and
s 11LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 300,902

had knowledge of the accident from any other source at or about the time
of the accident, or if it is found in the proceedings for settling the claim
that the employer is not, or would not, if a notice or an amended notice
were then given and the hearing postponed, be prejudiced in his defence
by the want, defect, or inaccuracy , or that such want, defect or inaccuracy
was occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause:
(b) the failure to make an application within the period above speciﬁed shall

known to the employer.
(2) An employer who fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) without

when so required under the provisions of subsection (5), or having submitted
himself for such treatment has disregarded the instructions of such medical
of f icer, then if it is proved that such failure or disregard was unreasonable in the
circumstances of the case and that the injury has been aggravated thereby the
injury and resulting incapacity shall be deemed to be of the same nature and
duration as they might reasonably have been expected to be if the worker had
submitted himself for treatment by , and duly carried out the instructions of, such
medical of f icer, and compensation, if any , shall be payable accordingly .
(7) Where under this section a right to compensation is suspended, no compensation
shall be payable in respect of the period of suspension save where the Court is
satisﬁed that there was reasonable cause on the part of the worker for failure to
attend on the medical of f icer.
(8) Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section, where a claim for
compensation is made in respect of the death of a worker, then if the worker
failed to submit to examination by a medical of f icer when so required under the
provisions of this section, or failed to submit himself for treatment by a medical
of f icer when so required under the provisions of this section, or having
submitted himself for such treatment disregarded the instructions of such
medical of f icer, and if it is proved that such failure or disregard was
unreasonable in the circumstances of the case and that the death of the worker
was caused thereby , the death shall not be deemed to have resulted from the
injury and no compensation shall be payable in respect of the injury .
(9) Where the employer has not at his own expense made suitable arrangements for
medical or surgical attendance in respect of an injured workman, the worker
shall, in addition to the compensation payable under section 7, 8, 9, or 10, be

the insurer. Such agreement shall be in duplicate, one copy to be kept by the
insurer and one copy to be kept by the worker:—
(a) the compensation agreed upon shall not be less than the amount payable
under the provisions of this Ordinance; and
(b) where the worker is unable to read the agreement and to appreciate the
ef fect thereof the agreement shall not be binding against him unless it is
endorsed by a certiﬁcate of a Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Court
to the ef fect that he read over and explained to the worker the terms
thereof and that the worker appeared fully to understand and approved of
the agreement.
(2) Any agreement made under subsection (1) may on application to the Court be
made an order of the Court.
(3) Where compensation has been agreed the Court may , notwithstanding that the
agreement has been made an order of the Court under the previous subsection,
on application by any party within 3 months after the date of the agreement,
cancel it and make such order (including an order as to any sum already paid
under the agreement) as in the circumstances the Court may think just, if it is
proved that the agreement was entered into in ignorance of or under a mistake
as to the true nature of the injury .
18 Determination of claims
If the insurer on whom notice of the accident has been served under section 14
does not within 14 days after the receipt of the notice agree in writing with the

compensation to the Court.

(1) Any periodical payment payable under this Ordinance, either under agreement
between the parties or under an order of the Court, may be reviewed by the
Court on the application either of the insurer or of the worker:

condition of the worker, any such application shall be supported by a certiﬁcate
of a medical practitioner.
(2) Any periodical payment may , on review under this section, subject to the
provisions of this Ordinance, be continued, increased, diminished, converted to
a lump sum, or ended. If the accident is found to have resulted in permanent
incapacity , the periodical payment shall be converted to the lump sum to which
the workman is entitled under the provisions of section 7 or 8, as the case may
be, less any amount which he has already received by way of periodical
payments.
(3) Where application is made by the insurer under this section for any periodical
payment to be ended or diminished, and the application is supported by the
certiﬁcate of a medical practitioner, the insurer may pay into Court the
periodical payment, or so much thereof as is equal to the amount by which he
contends that the periodical payment should be diminished, to abide the decision
of the Court made on a review under this section.
s 19 COOK ISLANDS WORKERS COMPENSA TION ORDINANCE 1964
Service 0301,401

Service 0 301,402

employer is not liable under such proceedings, the Court in which such
proceedings are taken shall, if the plaintif f so chooses, proceed to determine
whether compensation under this Ordinance is liable to be paid to the plaintif f
and shall assess the amount of compensation so payable, but may deduct from
such compensation any extra costs which in the opinion of the Court have been
incurred by the employer by reason of the proceedings having been taken
independently of this Ordinance.

employer to the worker the worker may prove for the balance in the bankruptcy
or liquidation, or as the case may be, he may recover the balance from the
receiver or manager.
25 Contracting out
Any contract or agreement, whether made before or after the commencement of
this Ordinance, whereby a worker relinquishes any right of compensation from
an employer for injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, shall

person to pay compensation under this Ordinance:
Provided that a worker who has obtained compensation in respect of permanent
partial or permanent total incapacity may enter into a contract reducing or
giving up his right to compensation under this Ordinance, in respect of any
future personal injury by accident if the Court declares such contract is certiﬁed
to be fair and reasonable.
