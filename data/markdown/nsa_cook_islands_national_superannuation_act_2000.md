52 Employer failing to make contribution deductions
(1) Where an employer fails to make any employee contribution the amount in
respect of which default has been made constitutes a debt payable by the
employer to the Board on behalf of the Fund, and is deemed to have become due
and payable by the employer to the Fund on the date on which payment of the
earnings was made or should have been made, and is recoverable accordingly .
(2) The right of the Board to recover from the employer the amount in respect of
which default has been made is in addition to any right of the Board to recover
that amount from the employee under this Part; and nothing in this Part may be
construed as preventing the Board from taking such steps as the Board thinks ﬁt
to recover that amount from the employer and from the employee concurrently ,
or from recovering that amount wholly or partly from each but the Board is not
entitled to recover the same amount from both the employer and employee.
(3) Where any amount payable in accordance with this Part by the employee is in
fact paid by the employer on behalf of the employee, the amount so paid may
be recovered by the employer from the employee.
(4) Where a penalty under section 67 is imposed on an amount in respect of which
default has been made, that penalty must upon recovery be applied for the
beneﬁt of the contributor on whose behalf the employee contribution should
have been made to the extent and as if the employee contribution were made and
interest accrued thereon, and any balance thereafter must be paid to the reserve
account of the Fund.
