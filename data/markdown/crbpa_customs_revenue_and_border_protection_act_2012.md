54 Search and viewing warrants
(1) This section applies to the following situation:
(a) the Comptroller considers, in the light of information of any kind that is
available to Customs, that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that—
(i) there exists a risk or threat relevant to the purpose stated in
section 46(1); or
(ii) a relevant of fence (as deﬁned in subsection (6) has been, is being,
or will be committed:
(b) Customs wishes—
(i) to search information to which access is given under section 49 to
determine whether it includes information that is relevant to
search criteria speciﬁed by Customs (being search criteria that are
reasonably related to the information available to Customs that
gives rise to the reasonable grounds to suspect required by
paragraph (a)); and
(ii) to view any information that is relevant to the search criteria
speciﬁed by Customs and is found as a result of the search:
(c) [Repealed]
(2) In that situation, the Comptroller may , by application in writing made on oath,
apply to a Judge or a Justice of the Peace for a search and viewing warrant
authorising—
(a) the carrying out of the search within 14 days after the day on which the
warrant is granted (or within any extension of that period granted by a
Judge or a Justice of the Peace on an application in writing for the
purpose made within that period); and
s 54 CUSTOMS REVENUE AND BORDER PROTECTION ACT 2012
Service 0906,301

(b) the viewing by Customs of any information that is relevant to the search
criteria speciﬁed by Customs and that is included in information to which
access is given under section 49, but of no other information.
(3) The application must give details of the reasonable grounds to suspect required
by subsection (1), of the information available to Customs that gives rise to
those reasonable grounds to suspect, and of the search criteria speciﬁed by
Customs, and it must also indicate whether the search is to be of all, or of only
a speciﬁed part or parts, of the information to which access is given under
section 49.
(4) On an application under subsection (2), a Judge or a Justice of the Peace may
grant a search and viewing warrant in the prescribed form, but only if he or she
is satisﬁed that—
(a) the reasonable grounds to suspect required by subsection (1) exist; and
(b) the search criteria speciﬁed by Customs are reasonably related to the
information available to Customs that gives rise to those reasonable
grounds to suspect.
(5) The warrant is suf f icient authority for the doing of the things speciﬁed in
subsection (2)(a) and (b).
(6) In this section and section 55, relevant of fence means an of fence described in

No 9).]
55 Search and viewing without warrant in emergencies
(1) This section applies to the following situation:
(a) the situation speciﬁed in section 54(1) applies:
(b) the Comptroller considers that, if he or she were to apply to a Judge for
a search and viewing warrant under section 54, the Judge would grant the
warrant:
(c) the Comptroller also considers that delaying a search and any resulting
viewing until a search and viewing warrant can be obtained under
section 54 would create a real risk that—
(i) the countering of the risk or threat referred to in section 54(1)(a)(i)
would be frustrated; or (as the case requires)
(ii) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, or
punishment of the relevant of fence would be frustrated.
(2) In that situation, the Comptroller may , with no further authority than this
section, have the things speciﬁed in section 54(2)(a) and (b) done as if the doing
of those things were authorised by a search and viewing warrant under
section 54(4).
(3) However, if the Comptroller acts under subsection (2), he or she must within
5 working days apply under section 54(2) for a search and viewing warrant in
relation to the matter.
56 Procedure if viewing of information not authorised
(1) This subsection applies to both of the following situations:
(a) the 5 working days period referred to in section 55(3) expires and the
Comptroller has not made the application required by that subsection:
s 54LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 906,302

(b) the application required by section 55(3) is made but, in response to it,
either no warrant is granted under section 54(4), or a warrant is granted
under section 54(4) authorising the doing of some only of the things done
in reliance on section 55(2).
(2) In a situation to which subsection (1) applies, things done in reliance on
section 55(2) must, to the extent that the doing of those things is not authorised
by a warrant granted under section 54(4), be treated for the purposes only of the
countering of the risk or threat referred to in section 54(1)(a)(i) or (as the case
requires) of the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, or punishment
of the relevant of fence, as if they were done without the authority of section 55
or of a warrant granted under section 54(4).
(3) In a situation to which subsection (1) applies,—
(a) the Customs must destroy immediately information viewed by it in
reliance on section 55(2) and that is collected by it for a purpose speciﬁed
in section 362 if the viewing of that information is not authorised by a
warrant granted under section 54(4); and
(b) other persons or bodies must destroy immediately information viewed by
the Customs in reliance on section 55(2) and disclosed by it to the other
persons or bodies for a purpose speciﬁed in section 363(2) and collected
by the other persons or bodies if the viewing of that information is not
authorised by a warrant granted under section 54(4).
57 Security of applications for warrants
(1) As soon as an application under section 54(2) has been determined by the Judge,
the Registrar must place all documents relating to the application (except the
warrant itself) in a packet, seal the packet, and thereafter keep it in safe custody ,
except as provided in this section.

subsection (1), except in accordance with this section.
(3) Every party of that kind who requires the production of a document held in safe
custody under subsection (1) must, except in a case to which subsection (9) or
(10) applies, apply in writing to the Registrar, who must promptly notify the
Comptroller.
(4) If, within 3 days after notice is given to the Comptroller under subsection (3),
the Comptroller gives written notice to the Registrar that he or she intends to
oppose the production of the documents, the Registrar must refer the matter to
a Judge.
(5) If the Comptroller does not give the written notice referred to in subsection (4),
the Registrar must produce the documents to the party applying for production.
(6) If a matter is referred to a Judge under subsection (4), both the person requesting
production of the documents and the Comptroller opposing production must be
given an opportunity to be heard.
(7) The Judge may order that all or a speciﬁed part of a document the production of
which is in dispute not be produced if he or she is satisﬁed that—

section 58(1); and
s 57 CUSTOMS REVENUE AND BORDER PROTECTION ACT 2012
Service 0906,303

(b) production of that information would involve disclosure of a kind
referred to in section 58(2).
(8) Subject to subsection (7), the Judge must order the production of the documents
to the party requesting it.
(9) If a request for the production of a document kept in safe custody under
subsection (1) is made in the course of proceedings presided over by a Judge
and the request is opposed, the Judge must adjudicate upon the matter as if it
had been referred to him or her under subsection (4).
(10) If a request of that kind is made in the course of any other proceedings, the
presiding judicial of f icer must promptly refer the matter to a Judge for
adjudication of the kind referred to in subsection (9).
(11) Despite anything in this section, every Judge who is presiding over any
proceedings in which the issue of a warrant under section 54 is in issue is
entitled to inspect any relevant document held under subsection (1).
58 Information and disclosure in section 57(7)

(5) Where, in the opinion of the Comptroller, the fair market value cannot be

(2) Originating goods or materials of a party used in the production of a good of
another party must be considered to originate in the latter party .
(3) Production that occurs in the territory of 1 or more of the parties by 1 or more

regardless of whether that production was suf f icient to confer originating status
to the materials themselves.
6 Minimal operations and processes

(b) must be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating
materials used in the production of the originating goods undergo the
applicable change in tarif f classiﬁcation or production process
requirements.
(2) If the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of the
accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional or other information materials

non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value
content of the good.

materials presented with the good are not customary for the good or are invoiced
separately from the good, they must be treated as separate goods for the purpose
of determining the origin.
9 Identical and interchangeable goods or materials
The determination of whether identical and interchangeable goods or materials
are originating goods must be made either:

(b) by the use of an inventory management method used throughout the ﬁscal
year of the person that selected the method and—

party in which the production is performed; or
(ii) accepted by that party in which production is performed.

determining whether all of the non-originating materials used in the production
of the good have met the applicable change in tarif f classiﬁcation or process of
production requirements as set out in a product speciﬁc rule.
(3) If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of the
packing materials and containers in which the good is packaged for retail sale
must be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the
case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
(4) If the packaging material and container is not customary for the good, its value
must not be included as originating in a regional value content calculation for
the good.
