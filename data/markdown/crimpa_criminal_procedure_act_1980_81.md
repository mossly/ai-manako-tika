section does not of itself deprive the person arresting, or his or her assistants, of
s 9 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT 1980-81
Service 1660,305

protection from criminal responsibility or civil proceeding, but is relevant to any
inquiry whether the arrest might not have been af fected, or the process or

(a) if it appears to the Court that the matter on which the defendant was

she has been charged in the information now before the Court, and that
the defendant might, on the former trial, if all proper amendments had
been made that might then have been made, have been convicted of all
the of fences of which he or she may be convicted on that information, the
Court must give judgment that he or she be discharged from that
information:
(b) if it appears to the Court that the defendant might on the former trial have
been convicted of any of fence of which he or she might be convicted on
that information, but that the defendant may be convicted on that
information of some of fence of which he or she could not have been
convicted on the former trial, the Court must direct that the defendant
must not be convicted on that information of any of fence of which he or

(b) if the defendant pleads not guilty to the rest of that charge, the allegation
must not be mentioned to the jury when he or she is given in charge to
them:

before he or she is called upon to say why sentence should not be passed
upon them, the defendant must be asked whether or not he or she has
been previously convicted as alleged, and if the defendant says that he or
she has not, or does not say that he or she has been so convicted, the jury
shall be charged to inquire into the matter, as in other cases.

evidence of his or her good character is given on the part of the defendant, the

the defendant was formerly charged, but adds a statement of intention or
circumstances of aggravation tending if proved to increase the punishment, the
previous acquittal or conviction is a bar to the information.

manslaughter or infanticide is a bar to a second information for the same
homicide charging it as any one of those of fences.
(3) If on the trial of an issue on a plea of previous acquittal or conviction to an
information charging murder or manslaughter or infanticide, it appears that the
former trial was for an of fence against the person alleged now to have been
killed, and that the death of that person is now alleged to have been caused by
the of fence previously charged, but that the death happened after the trial on
which the defendant was acquitted or convicted, as the case may be, then, if it
appears that on the former trial the defendant might if convicted have been
sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years or upwards, the Court must direct that the
defendant be discharged from the information before it. If it does not so appear,
the Court must direct that he or she plead.

(ii) section 321 (which relates to the of fence of wilful damage).
122 Application to be treated as information
An application under section 121 must be made by motion, and must be
received by the Court and be proceeded with in all respects as if it is an
information laid by the applicant against the defendant for an of fence and as if
the ground of the application is the alleged of fence; and the provisions of Part 1
apply to the hearing of such applications insofar as they are consistent with this
section, sections 121, and 123 to 127.
123 Making of order for bond
(1) If on the hearing of any such application the Court considers that there is good
ground to do so, it may order the defendant to enter, with or without a surety or
sureties, as the Court thinks ﬁt, into a bond in such sum or sums as the Court
thinks suf f icient, subject to the condition that the defendant keep the peace
towards the applicant and refrain from doing the act feared, or from repeating
the conduct complained of, or from doing the act threatened, as the case may be,
for such time, not exceeding 1 year from the date of the bond, as is ﬁxed by the
order.
(2) No order may be made under this section, unless,—
(a) in the case of an application upon the ground or grounds provided in
section 121(a), the Court is satisﬁed that the applicant has just cause for
his or her fear; or
Service 0663,001

(b) in the case of an application upon the ground or grounds provided in
paragraph (b), the Court is of opinion that the conduct complained of is
likely to be repeated and may tend to provoke a breach of the peace; or
(c) in the case of an application upon the ground or grounds provided in
paragraph (c), the Court is satisﬁed that there is just cause for fear that the
defendant will, if not prevented, carry the threats into execution.
(3) A bond under this section must be in Form 18, and may be entered into by any
of the parties to it before any Justice or the Registrar, and it is not necessary for
all the parties to the bond to be present at the same time or at the same place,

bond is entered into must give to each of the persons entering into it before him
or her a notice in Form 19.
(4) In any case where a surety or sureties are required, the Court may at any time,
if it is satisﬁed that the defendant is unable to obtain the surety or sureties, order
that the surety or any or all of the sureties be dispensed with.
124 Making of order for bond where person charged with of fence
Where any person is charged before a Court presided over by a Judge or a
Justice or Justices with an of fence, and the evidence establishes one of the
grounds which would justify the making of an order for a bond for keeping the
peace, then, whether or not the defendant is convicted of the of fence and
whether or not any penalty is imposed on him or her in respect of the of fence,
the Court may make such an order as if an application therefor had been made

so to do or fails to obtain a surety or sureties as required by the order, the Court
(except where the Court is presided over by a Justice or Justices) may order that
they be committed to a prison for any period not exceeding 2 months:
Provided that a defendant who has failed to obtain the required surety or sureties
must not be ordered to be committed to a prison if they satisfy the Court that
they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the surety or sureties:
Provided further that a defendant who has been committed to a prison must be
immediately released if their committal was based on refusal to enter into a
bond and they enter into the bond; or if their committal was based on failure to
obtain a surety or sureties and they obtain the required surety or sureties, or
before the expiry of the period of their detention satisﬁes a Court presided over
by a Justice that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the surety or sureties.
126 Person imprisoned in default of ﬁnding sureties may be released
If the person for whose protection a Court has required the defendant to ﬁnd a
surety or sureties of the peace dies, or for some other reason that person no
longer requires protection, and the defendant is then in a prison in default of
ﬁnding the surety or sureties, a Court presided over by a Justice may , if it thinks
ﬁt, order that the defendant be released from custody without ﬁnding the surety
or sureties.
127 Order calling up bond
(1) Any person who has obtained an order requiring any other person to enter into

hearing of the application, and must, not less than 7 days before the time ﬁxed,
cause to be served on every person bound by the bond a notice of the time and

it thinks ﬁt as to any person bound thereby on whom notice is proved to have
been served in accordance with this section. Any penalty payable in accordance
with this subsection is recoverable as if it were a ﬁne.
