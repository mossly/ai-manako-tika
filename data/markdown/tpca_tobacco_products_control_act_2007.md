of product anywhere they may be found and have them removed
from that place for the purposes of testing:

alteration of any tobacco or tobacco product wherever found, if
the authorised of f icer reasonably believes that tobacco or tobacco
product does not comply with the requirements of the Act or
regulations made under the Act, providing (at the time of
exercising this power or so soon thereafter as is reasonably
practical in the circumstances) to the owner or apparent owner of
that tobacco or tobacco product written notice of the exercise of

the absence of the owner or apparent owner that notice must
instead be provided to any other person at that place who appears,
to the authorised of f icer, to have charge of that place:
(vii) to seize and detain any tobacco or tobacco product where that
tobacco or tobacco product is of fered for sale or is sold by a
person in a manner which that authorised of f icer reasonably

made under the Act, it must be returned immediately to the place from which it
was seized.

in the exercise of the power contained in subsection (1)(b)(vii) it must be

day of the seizure any person having either an equitable or legal interest in the
property (including any chargeholder) has made application to the High Court
for relief against forfeiture.
