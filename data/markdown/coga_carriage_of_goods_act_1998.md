s 8 CARRIAGE OF GOODS ACT 1998
Service 0755,303

(2) Subject to the following provisions of this section, where in any contract of
carriage the term “at owner’s risk”, “at limited carrier’s risk”, “at declared value
risk”, or “on declared terms” is used, the contract is deemed for the purposes of
this Act to be one to which subsection (1)(a), (b), (c), or (d) (as the case may
require) applies.
(3) Subject to the provisions of this section, the kind of contract of carriage to be
entered into in a particular case is a matter for agreement between the parties.
(4) Where the contract does not purport to be of a particular kind, it is deemed for
the purposes of this Act to be a contract for carriage “at limited carrier’s risk”.
(5) No contract of carriage purporting to be a contract for carriage “at owner’s risk”
has ef fect as such (but instead has ef fect as a contract for carriage “at limited
carrier’s risk”) unless—
(a) the contract is—
(i) in writing; and
(ii) expressed to be “at owner’s risk”; and
(iii) signed by the parties or their agents; or
(b) before, or at the time when, the goods are accepted for carriage, the
contracting party or his or her agent signs a statement in the following
terms:
“These goods are to be carried “at owner’s risk”. This means that the
carrier will pay no compensation if the goods are lost or damaged, unless he
intentionally loses or damages them.”
For the purposes of this paragraph, that statement may be included in the
consignment note or any other document relating to the carriage, but in that
case the statement shall be conspicuous and shall be separately signed by
the contracting party or their agent.
(6) No contract of carriage purporting to be a contract “at declared value risk” has
ef fect as such (but instead has ef fect as a contract for carriage “at limited
carrier’s risk”) unless the contract is in writing.
(7) No contract of carriage purporting to be a contract for carriage “on declared
terms” has ef fect as such (but instead has ef fect as a contract for carriage “at
limited carrier’s risk”) unless the contract is—
(a) freely negotiated between the parties; and
(b) in writing; and
(c) signed by the parties or their agents.
(8) Where in any proceeding the question of whether any contract of carriage was
or was not freely negotiated is in issue, the Court in determining that question
must have regard to the following matters:
(a) the respective bargaining strengths of the parties:
(b) the course of dealing between the parties in respect of the particular
transaction in question, and any other transactions between them:
(c) the value of the transaction:
(d) any extraordinary features of the goods to be carried or the route over
which they are to be carried:
(e) any other matters that the Court considers may properly be taken into
account,—

as such (but instead has ef fect as a contract for carriage “at limited carrier’s
s 8LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 755,304

risk”) unless the amount by which the freight charged by the contracting carrier
under the contract dif fers from the amount that the carrier would have charged
for the same carriage at limited carrier’s risk is fair and reasonable, having
regard to the dif ference in the risk actually undertaken by the carrier and the risk
that they would have undertaken if the carriage had been “at limited carrier’s
risk”.
(10) For the purposes of subsection (9), any rate of freight prescribed by or under any
enactment in respect of any mode of carriage pursuant to any kind of contract of
carriage shall be deemed to be a fair and reasonable rate to charge for such
carriage.
(11) Any contract of carriage entered into by a contracting carrier with an actual
carrier, or between actual carriers, may be of any kind, regardless of the kind of
contract that subsists between the contracting carrier and the contracting party;
but subsections (5) to (8) shall not apply in respect of any such contract.
(12) The provisions of sections 9, 14, and 15 apply to contracts for carriage “at
limited carrier’s risk” and to contracts for carriage “at declared value risk”.
(13) Sections 9(1), 14, and 15 do not apply to contracts for carriage “at owner’s risk”
or to contracts for carriage “on declared terms”.

declared terms”, subject to any express term in the contract.

where a contract of carriage is to be or is performed wholly or partly by one or
more actual carriers other than the contracting carrier (whether or not the

involved—
(a) subject to subsection (4), the actual carriers are, subject to the terms of
their respective contracts, jointly liable as such to the contracting carrier

carriers or any of them:
(b) each actual carrier is, subject to the terms of their contract, separately
liable as such to the contracting carrier for the loss of or damage to any

carrier is insolvent or cannot with reasonable diligence be found, the contracting
party is entitled to the same rights (if any) against the actual carrier as the
contracting carrier has under section 10(3)(b).
(2) Where the liquidator or assignee in bankruptcy of an insolvent contracting
carrier brings any proceeding against an actual carrier in respect of any right
referred to in subsection (1), the sum recovered from the actual carrier, less all
costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the liquidator or assignee in bringing
and prosecuting the proceeding and not recovered by them from the actual
carrier, must be held by the liquidator or assignee upon the following trusts:
(a) for or towards the payment of the whole of the sum payable by the
contracting carrier to the contracting party in respect of the loss of or
damage to the goods:
(b) subject to that payment, as an asset in liquidation or bankruptcy .
(3) Where the contracting party brings any proceeding against an actual carrier in
respect of any right referred to in subsection (1)—

(including the right of set-of f) as they would have had under the contract
if the proceeding had been brought against them by the contracting
carrier:
(b) if judgment in the proceeding is awarded against the actual carrier, that
judgment is an absolute bar to the bringing by the contracting carrier, or
by any person claiming through the contracting carrier, of any proceeding
to enforce the same right.

enactment.

proper notice.

to impose, where it considers that the delay in bringing the action was
occasioned by mistake of fact or by mistake of any matter of law (other than the
provisions of this section) or by any other reasonable cause, and that the
intended defendant was not materially prejudiced in their defence or otherwise
by the delay .
20 Actions by consignee if not contracting party

recoverable expenses , means all expenses and charges that the carrier, in
accordance with subsection (6)(b), is entitled to recover from the owner of any
goods in respect of which the carrier is exercising or has exercised a lien in

lien over the goods, which may be exercised in accordance with this section.
(3) Every carrier claiming a lien over any goods under this section must give notice
of the carrier’s claim to the owner of the goods, specifying the amount and
particulars of the claim, and requiring the owner to pay or secure to the carrier
the amount of the freight claimed and all recoverable expenses.

and storing the goods pending settlement of the carrier’s claim, and in
arranging and conducting the sale of the goods,—
and must pay the balance (if any) to the owner of the goods.

carrier and all recoverable expenses, the deﬁciency constitutes a debt due to the
carrier by the owner of the goods.

lien over any goods to which a carrier may be entitled by virtue of any provision
expressed or implied in the contract of carriage.

found or (otherwise than because of any default by the carrier) he or she
refuses to accept the goods,—

suitable premises for storage.

entitled to an active and particular lien over the goods, which may be exercised

carriage of the goods and all reasonable expenses incurred by the carrier in
holding the goods and in conducting the sale, and must tender the balance (if
any) to the consignee.

incurred by the carrier are recoverable by the consignee from the contracting

order to avoid the threat of harm to any persons or property , to destroy or
otherwise dispose of the goods forthwith, the carrier may do so.

or otherwise disposing of the goods shall be recoverable by the carrier from the
contracting party .

destroyed or otherwise disposed of under and in accordance with any of
sections 23 to 26, neither the contracting carrier nor any actual carrier is under
any liability (whether under this Act or otherwise) in respect of that sale,
