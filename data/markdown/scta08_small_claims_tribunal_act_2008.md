in relation to the claim,

enforce an order provided for by section 19(3) (requiring a party to pay money
s 41 SMALL CLAIMS TRIBUNAL ACT 2008

to another as an alternative to compliance with a work order), the Registrar must
give notice of the application to the party against whom enforcement is sought.

a notice of objection in the prescribed form, the order may , after the expiry of
that period, be enforced pursuant to subsection (1).
(4) The notice referred to in subsection (3) may only be given on the ground that it
is the belief of the party that the order of the Tribunal has been fully complied
with and that that party therefore disputes the entitlement of the applicant to
enforce it.
(5) If the party against whom enforcement is sought ﬁles the notice referred to in
subsection (3) within the prescribed time, the Registrar must refer the matter to
the Tribunal to be heard and determined under section 42(2).

(a) a party in whose favour a work order has been made considers that the
work order has not been complied with by the other party; and
(b) that other party has not complied with the alternative money order
provided for by section 19(3)—

the High Court for the issue of a process for enforcement pursuant to
section 41(1), lodge in the Tribunal a request in the prescribed form that the
work order be enforced.
(2) Subsequent proceedings shall be taken on a request for enforcement under
subsection (1) and on a notice under section 41(5) as if such request or notice
were a claim lodged under section 24; and upon the hearing of the matter the
Tribunal may—
(a) vary the work order, or make a further work order, or any other order that
is authorised by section 19;
(b) grant leave to the party in whose favour the work order was made to
enforce the alternative money order provided for by section 19(3), or so
much of that order as the Tribunal may allow , and either subject to or
without compliance with the provisions of section 41(2);
(c) discharge any order previously made by the Tribunal.
(3) After the expiration of 12 months from the date of a work order, it may not be
enforced without the leave of the Tribunal.
43 Enforcement of agreed settlements
(1) Where a term of an agreed settlement approved by the Tribunal under

another party , that term is deemed to be an order of the High Court of which the
Tribunal is a division, and may be enforced accordingly .
(2) Where—
(a) a term of an agreed settlement approved by the Tribunal under
section 18(3) provides for a party to make good a defect in any property ,
or a deﬁciency in the performance of services, by doing such work or

may be speciﬁed in the agreement; and
s 41LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 137,504

(b) a party who would beneﬁt by the enforcement of that term considers that
the term has not been complied with by the other party ,
the party who would beneﬁt by the enforcement of the term may lodge in the
Tribunal a request in the prescribed form for that term to be enforced.
(3) Subsequent proceedings shall be taken on a request for enforcement under
subsection (2) as if such request were a claim lodged under section 24; and upon
the hearing of the matter the Tribunal may—
(a) if the parties so agree, vary the term of the agreed settlement that is
sought to be enforced, or any other term of that settlement;
(b) strike out the term of the agreed settlement that is sought to be enforced
and, subject to section 19(4), order the party against whom enforcement
of the term is sought to pay money to the party seeking to enforce it.
44 No ﬁling fee payable
No ﬁling fee is payable by a person who, pursuant to section 41(1) or
section 43(1), seeks to enforce an order or a term of an agreed settlement, but

(2) A rehearing may be ordered under subsection (1) only—
(a) where an order has been made under section 18(8); or
(b) where an order has been made under section 42(2) or 43(3)(b), or a term
of an agreed settlement has been varied under section 43(3)(a), and, in all
such cases, is limited to rehearing the enforcement proceedings taken
under those sections; or
(c) where an agreed settlement has been approved by the Tribunal under
section 18(3) and, after the hearing, a party to the settlement discovers
facts directly relevant to the dispute that could not, with reasonable
diligence, have been obtained before the hearing and that, if known at the
time, would have had a bearing on whether that party agreed to the
settlement.
(3) Every application for a rehearing must be made, accompanied by the prescribed
fee, within 21 days after the Tribunal’s order (or, in the case of an agreed
settlement, the Tribunal’s approval of the settlement or the variation of a term of
that settlement under section 43(3)(a) as the case may require) or within such
further time not exceeding 3 months as the Tribunal may , on application, allow ,
and must be served upon the other parties to the proceedings.
(4) Upon a rehearing being granted,—
(a) the Registrar must notify all parties to the proceedings of the making of
the order and of the time and place appointed for the rehearing; and
(b) the order or approval or variation made or given by the Tribunal upon the
ﬁrst hearing ceases to have ef fect.
(5) Despite subsection (4)(b), if the party on whose application a rehearing is
ordered does not appear at the time and place for the rehearing or at any time
and place to which the rehearing is adjourned, the Tribunal may , without
rehearing or further rehearing the claim, direct that the original order or
approval or variation, as the case may be, be restored to full force and ef fect.
(6) This Act applies to a rehearing in all respects as it applies to an original hearing.
46 Appeals
(1) Any party to proceedings before the Tribunal may appeal to a High Court
against an order made by the Tribunal under section 18(8), 42(2), or 43(3)(b), or
against the approval by the Tribunal of an agreed settlement under section 18(3),
or against the variation of a term of an agreed settlement under section 43(3)(a),
on the grounds that—
(a) the proceedings were conducted by the Referee; or
(b) an inquiry was carried out by an Investigator,
in a manner that was unfair to the appellant and prejudicially af fected the result
of the proceedings.
Service 0138,001

(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a Referee is deemed to have
conducted the proceedings in a manner that was unfair to the appellant and
prejudicially af fected the result if—
(a) the Referee fails to have regard to any provision of any enactment that is
brought to the attention of the Referee at the hearing; and
(b) as a result of that failure, the result of the proceedings is unfair to the
appellant.
(3) An appeal must be brought by a party by the ﬁling of a notice of appeal, in the
prescribed form, together with the prescribed fee, in the High Court, within
21 days of the making or giving of the order or approval or variation appealed
against, or within such further time not exceeding 3 months as a High Court
Judge may , on application, allow .
(4) As soon as practicable after such notice of appeal has been ﬁled, the Registrar
must lodge a copy of the notice in the Tribunal’s records relating to the
proceedings.

notify the appellant.
(6) A copy of every notice of appeal together with a notice of the time and place for
hearing the appeal must be served by the Registrar on every other party to the
proceedings before the Tribunal, and each such party may appear and be heard.
(7) The ﬁling of a notice of appeal against an order or the approval of an agreed
settlement or the variation of a term of an agreed settlement operates as a stay
of any process for the enforcement of that order or that settlement or that
variation, as the case may require, but a Judge of the High Court may at any
time, on the application of a party to the proceedings, order that any process
may be resumed or commenced or, the process having been resumed or
commenced, order that it be further stayed.
47 Referee or Investigator to furnish report
(1) Within 28 days after the notice of appeal has been lodged in the Tribunal’s
records under section 46(4), the Referee who heard the proceedings and, where
applicable, the Investigator, must furnish to the Registrar a report on the manner
in which the proceedings were, or where applicable the inquiry was, conducted
and the reasons therefor.
(2) A Referee must keep a record of the proceedings of the Tribunal suf f icient to
enable that Referee, if required, to furnish a report under subsection (1), and an
Investigator must do likewise in relation to an inquiry conducted by that
Investigator.
(3) Where, for any reason, the Referee who heard the proceedings or, where
applicable, the Investigator, is unavailable to furnish the report, the report must
be compiled by the Registrar from such information as the Registrar is able to
collect from the records of the Tribunal or otherwise.
(4) The Registrar must ensure that a copy of the report furnished or compiled under
subsection (1) or (3) is made available to the appellant, and to every other party
to the proceedings, a reasonable time before the hearing of the appeal.
48 Powers of High Court Judge on appeal
(1) On the hearing of the appeal a High Court Judge may—
s 46LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS

(a) quash the order or the approval or the variation, as the case may be, and
order a rehearing of the claim in the Tribunal on such terms as the Judge
thinks ﬁt; or
(b) quash the order or the approval or the variation, as the case may be, and
transfer the proceedings to the High Court for hearing; or
(c) dismiss the appeal.
(2) In ordering a rehearing under subsection (1)(a), the Judge may give to the
Tribunal such directions as the Judge thinks ﬁt as to the conduct of the
rehearing.
