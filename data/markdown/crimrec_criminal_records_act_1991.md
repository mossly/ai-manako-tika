[Section 2 summary conviction: inserted, on 13 December 1991, by section 2 of the Criminal

3 Application for pardon
A person or any living next of kin of a deceased person who has been convicted

the Board.
(2) The Board must cause proper inquiries to be made in order to ascertain the
behaviour of the applicant since the date of his or her conviction, but such
inquiries must not be made—
(a) where the applicant was convicted of an of fence punishable on summary
conviction in proceedings under Part 2 of the Criminal Procedures
Act 1980–81 until, in the case of the imposition on the applicant of—
(i) a sentence of imprisonment; or
(ii) a period of probation; or
(iii) a ﬁne,
2 years have elapsed since the termination of the sentence of
imprisonment, the termination of the period of probation, or the payment
of the ﬁne, as the case may be, or in the case of the imposition on the
applicant of—
CRIMINAL RECORDS ACT 1991
Service 00

(iv) a period of probation in addition to a ﬁne; or
(v) a ﬁne in addition to a sentence of imprisonment,
2 years have elapsed since the later of the termination of the sentence of
imprisonment, the termination of the period of probation or the payment
of the ﬁne, as the case may be; or
(b) in any other case, until 5 years have elapsed since the date from which the
2 years period provided in paragraph (a) would have been computed, if
that paragraph had been applicable to the applicant.
(3) For the purposes of this section, in calculating the period of any sentence of
imprisonment imposed on an applicant there must be included, in addition to
any time spent by the applicant in custody pursuant to that sentence, any period
of statutory remission granted to him or her in respect thereof.
(4) The chairperson of the Board must direct a probation of f icer to undertake
inquiries for the purpose of a pardon.
(5) The probation of f icer must report to the Board on the character and personal
history of the applicant.
(6) The probation of f icer may make recommendations to the Board as to the best
method of dealing with the application.
(7) Upon completion of its inquiries, the Board must report the result thereof to the
Minister with its recommendation as to whether a pardon should be granted but,
if the Board proposes to recommend that a pardon should not be granted, it
must, before making such a recommendation, forthwith so notify the applicant
and advise them that they are entitled to make any representations to the Board
that the applicant believes are relevant; and the Board must consider any oral or
written representations made to it by or on behalf of the applicant within a
reasonable time after any such notice is given and before making a report under
this subsection.
(8) Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Board that a pardon should be
granted, the Minister must refer the recommendation to the Queen’s
Representative in Executive Council who may grant the pardon which must be
in the form set out in the Schedule.
5 Ef fect of grant of pardon
The grant of pardon—
(a) is evidence of the fact that the Board, after making proper inquiries, was
satisﬁed that an applicant was of good behaviour and that the conviction
in respect of which the pardon is granted should no longer reﬂect
adversely on the applicant’s character; and
(b) unless the pardon is subsequently revoked, vacates the conviction in
respect of which it is granted and, without restricting the generality of the
foregoing, removes any disqualiﬁcation to which the person so convicted
is, by reason of such conviction, subject by virtue of any Act of the
Parliament of the Cook Islands or a regulation made thereunder.
6 Custody of records
(1) The Minister may by order in writing addressed to any person having the
custody or control of any judicial record of a conviction in respect of which a
pardon has been granted, require that person to deliver such record into the
custody of the Commissioner of Police.
s 6 LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 1

(2) Any record of a conviction in respect of which a pardon has been granted that
is in the custody of the Commissioner or of any department or agency of the
Government of the Cook Islands must be kept separate and apart from other
criminal records, and no such record may be disclosed to any person, nor may
the existence of the record or the fact of the conviction be disclosed to any
person, without the prior approval of the Minister who must, before granting
such approval, be satisﬁed that the disclosure is desirable in the interests of the
administration of justice or for any purpose related to the safety or security of
the Cook Islands or any state allied or associated with the Cook Islands.
(3) Despite subsection (2), the court, upon a conviction for a similar or related
of fence, must not refuse to consider for sentencing purposes any record of
conviction in respect of which a pardon has been granted.
7 Revocation
A pardon may be revoked by the Queen’s Representative in Executive
Council—
(a) if the person to whom it is granted is subsequently convicted of a further
of fence under an Act of the Parliament of the Cook Islands or a regulation
made thereunder; or
(b) upon evidence establishing to the satisfaction of the Queen’s
Representative in Executive Council—
(i) that the person to whom it was granted is no longer of good
conduct; or
(ii) that such person knowingly made a false or deceptive statement in
relation to their application for the pardon, or knowingly
concealed some material particular in relation to such application.
8 General
No application form for or relating to—
(a) employment in any department pursuant to the Public Service Act 1975:
(b) employment by any Crown, Corporation or ad hoc agency of the
Government:
(c) employment upon or in connection with the operation of any work,
undertaking or business that is within the legislative authority of the
Parliament of the Cook Islands—
may contain any question that by its terms requires the applicant to disclose a
conviction in respect of which he has been granted a pardon that has not been
revoked.
9 Limitation

Procedures Act, or of the letters Patent constituting the Of f ice of the Queen’s
Representative of the Cook Islands relating to pardons, except that sections 6
and 8 apply in respect of any pardon granted either before or after the
