Compare: 1895 No 23 s 18
19 Property passes when intended to pass
(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of speciﬁc or ascertained goods, the
property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the
contract intend it to be transferred.
(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had
to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances of
the case.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 19
20 Rules for ascertaining intention
Unless a dif ferent intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the
intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to
pass to the buyer:
Rule 1 Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of speciﬁc goods, in a
deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the
contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the
time of delivery , or both, is postponed.
Rule 2 Where there is a contract for the sale of speciﬁc goods, and the seller is
bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a
deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done and the
buyer has notice thereof.
Rule 3 Where there is a contract for the sale of speciﬁc goods in a deliverable state,
but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing
with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the
property does not pass until such act or thing is done, and the buyer has
notice thereof.
Rule 4 Where goods are delivered to the buyer on approval, or “on sale or return”
or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer—
(a) when he signiﬁes his approval or acceptance to the seller, or
does any other act adopting the transaction:
(b) if he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller,
but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection then, if
a time has been ﬁxed for the return of the goods, on the
expiration of such time, and if no time has been ﬁxed, on the
expiration of a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a
question of fact.
Service 0853,301

Rule 5 (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of ascertained or future goods by
description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state
are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller
with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the
seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such
assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before
or after the appropriation is made.
(2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to
the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer
or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not
reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally
appropriated the goods to the contract.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 20
21 Reservation of right of disposal
(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of speciﬁc goods, or where goods are
subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may , by the terms of the
contract or appropriation, reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain
conditions are fulﬁlled.
(2) In such case, notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer, or to a
carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, the property
in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the seller
are fulﬁlled.
(3) Where goods are shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to
the order of the seller or his agent, the seller is prima facie deemed to reserve
the right of disposal.
(4) Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price, and transmits the bill
of exchange and bill of lading to the buyer together to secure acceptance or
payment of the bill of exchange, the buyer is bound to return the bill of lading
if he does not honour the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill
of lading the property in the goods does not pass to him.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 21
22 Risk prima facie passes with property
(1) Unless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the seller’s risk until the property
therein is transferred to the buyer; but when the property therein is transferred
to the buyer the goods are at the buyer’s risk, whether delivery has been made
or not:
Provided that where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either buyer
or seller, the goods are at risk of the party in fault as regards any loss which
might not have occurred but for such fault.
(2) Nothing in this section shall af fect the duties or liabilities of either seller or
buyer as a bailee of the goods of the other party .

seller had, unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from
denying the seller’s authority to sell.

(a) the provisions of the Mercantile Law Act 1908, or any other enactment
enabling the apparent owner of goods to dispose of them as if he were the
true owner thereof:

25 Sale under voidable title
Where the seller of goods has a voidable title thereto, but his title has not been
avoided at the time of the sale, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods,
provided he buys them in good faith and without notice of the seller’s defect of
title.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 25
26 Revesting of property in stolen goods on conviction of of fender
(1) Where goods have been stolen and the of fender is prosecuted to conviction, the
property in the goods so stolen revests in the person who was the owner of the
goods, or his personal representative, notwithstanding any intermediate dealing
with them, whether by sale in market overt or otherwise.
(2) Notwithstanding any enactment to the contrary , where goods have been
obtained by fraud or other wrongful means not amounting to theft, the property
in such goods shall not revest in the person who was the owner of the goods, or
his personal representative, by reason only of the conviction of the of fender.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 26
27 Seller or buyer in possession after sale
(1) Where a person having sold goods continues or is in possession of the goods, or
of the documents of title to the goods, the delivery or transfer by that person, or
by a mercantile agent acting for him, of the goods or documents of title under
any sale, pledge, or other disposition thereof, or under any agreement for sale,
pledge, or other disposition thereof, to any person receiving the same in good
faith and without notice of the previous sale, shall have the same ef fect as if the
person making the delivery or transfer were expressly authorised by the owner
of the goods to make the same.
(2) Where a person, having bought or agreed to buy goods, obtains, with the
consent of the seller, possession of the goods or the documents of title to the
goods, the delivery or transfer by that person, or by a mercantile agent acting for

Service 0853,303

lien or other right of the original seller in respect of the goods, shall have the
same ef fect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were a mercantile
agent in possession of the goods or documents of title with the consent of the
owner:
Provided that if the lien or other right of the original seller is expressed in an
instrument duly registered under the Chattels Transfer Act 1924, and if the
person selling, pledging, or disposing of the goods or agreeing so to do is the
mortgagor or bailee named in such instrument, then the person receiving the
goods shall be deemed to have had notice of the contents of such instrument.
(3) In this section mercantile agent has the same meaning as in Part 1 of the
Mercantile Law Act 1908.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 27, 1890 No 11 ss 10 and 11

Compare: 1895 No 23 s 30

seller’s place of business, if he has one, and if not, his residence:
Provided that if the contract is for the sale of speciﬁc goods, which to the
knowledge of the parties when the contract is made are in some other place, then

goods so delivered he must pay for them at the contract rate.

goods of a dif ferent description not included in the contract, the buyer may
accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest or

instalments, which are to be separately paid for, and the seller makes defective
deliveries in respect one or more instalments, or the buyer neglects or refuses
take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments, it is a question in each case
depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case,
whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract or whether
it is a severable breach, giving rise to a claim for compensation but not to a right
to treat the whole contract as repudiated.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 33
34 Delivery to carrier
(1) Where, under a contract of sale, the seller is authorised or required to send the
goods to the buyer, delivery of the goods to a carrier, whether named by the
buyer or not, for the purpose of transmission to the buyer is prima facie deemed
to be a delivery of the goods to the buyer.
(2) Unless otherwise authorised by the buyer, the seller must make such contract
with the carrier on behalf of the buyer as may be reasonable, having regard to
the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case. If the seller omits
so to do, and the goods are lost or damaged in course of transit, the buyer may
decline to treat the delivery to the carrier as a delivery to himself, or may hold
the seller responsible in damages.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are sent by the seller to the buyer by a
route involving sea transit, under circumstances in which it is usual to insure,
the seller must give such notice to the buyer as may enable him to insure them
during their sea transit, and, if the seller fails to do so, the goods shall be deemed
to be at his risk during such sea transit.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 34
35 Risk where goods delivered at distant place
Where the seller of goods agrees to deliver them at his own risk at a place other
than that where they are when sold, the buyer must, nevertheless, unless
otherwise agreed, take any risk of deterioration in the goods necessarily incident
to the course of transit.

he is bound, on request, to af ford the buyer a reasonable opportunity of
examining the goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in
conformity with the contract.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 36
37 Acceptance
The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller
that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him, and
he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of
the seller, or when after the lapse of a reasonable time he retains the goods,
without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.

occasioned by his neglect or refusal to take delivery , and also for a reasonable

Provided that nothing in this section shall af fect the rights of the seller where the
neglect or refusal of the buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation of the
contract.

of the goods as long as they are in course of transit, and may retain them until
payment or tender of the price.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 45
46 Duration of transit
(1) Goods are deemed to be in course of transit from the time when they are
delivered to a carrier by land or water, or other bailee for the purpose of
transmission to the buyer, until the buyer, or his agent in other behalf, takes
delivery of them from such carrier or other bailee.
(2) If the buyer or his agent in that behalf obtains delivery of the goods before their
arrival at the appointed destination, the transit is at an end.
(3) If, after the arrival of the goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other
bailee acknowledges to the buyer or his agent that he holds the goods on his
behalf, and continues in possession of them as bailee for the buyer, or his agent,
the transit is at an end, and it is immaterial that a further destination for the
goods may have been indicated by the buyer.
(4) If the goods are rejected by the buyer, and the carrier or other bailee continues
in possession of them, the transit is not deemed to be at an end, even if the seller
has refused to receive them back.

depending on the circumstances of the particular case, whether they are in the
possession of the master as a carrier or as agent to the buyer.
(6) Where the carrier or other bailee wrongfully refuses to deliver the goods to the
buyer, or his agent in that behalf, the transit is deemed to be at an end.

Service 0 859,302

47 How stoppage in transitu is af fected
(1) The unpaid seller may exercise his right of stoppage in transitu either by taking
actual possession of the goods, or by giving notice of his claim to the carrier or
other bailee in whose possession the goods are. Such notice may be given either
to the person in actual possession of the goods or to his principal. In the latter
case the notice, to be ef fectual, must be given at such time and under such
circumstances that the principal, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may
communicate it to his servant or agent in time to prevent a delivery to the buyer.
(2) When notice of stoppage in transitu is given by the seller to the carrier, or other
bailee in possession of the goods, he must redeliver the goods to or according to
directions of the seller. The expenses of such redelivery must be borne by the
seller.

Resale by Buyer or Seller
48 Ef fect of subsale or pledge by buyer
Subject to the provisions of this Act, the unpaid seller’s right of lien or retention
or stoppage in transitu is not af fected by any sale or other disposition of the
goods which the buyer may have made, unless the seller has assented thereto:
Provided that where a document of title to goods has been lawfully transferred
to any person as buyer or owner of the goods, and that person transfers the
document to a person who takes the document in good faith and for valuable
consideration, then, if such last-mentioned transfer was by way of sale, the
unpaid seller’s right of lien or retention or stoppage in transitu is defeated, and
if such last-mentioned transfer was by way of pledge or other disposition for
value, the unpaid seller’s right of lien or retention or stoppage in transitu can
only be exercised subject to the rights of the transferee.
Compare: 1895 No 23 s 48
49 Sale not generally rescinded by lien or stoppage in transitu
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a contract of sale is not rescinded by the
mere exercise by an unpaid seller of his right of lien or retention or stoppage in
transitu.
(2) Where an unpaid seller who has exercised his right of lien or retention or
stoppage in transitu resells the goods, the buyer acquires a good title thereto as
against the original buyer.
(3) Where the goods are of a perishable nature, or where the unpaid seller gives
notice to the buyer of his intention to resell, and the buyer does not within a
reasonable time pay or tender the price, the unpaid seller may resell the goods
and recover from the original buyer damages for any loss occasioned by his
breach of contract.
(4) Where the seller expressly reserves a right of resale in case the buyer should
make default, and on the buyer making default resells the goods, the original
contract of sale is thereby rescinded, but without prejudice to any claim the
seller may have for damages.

51 Damages for non-acceptance
(1) Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods,

(2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in
the ordinary course of events, from the buyer’s breach of contract.
(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of
damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the dif ference between the contract
price and the market or current price at the time or times when the goods ought
to have been accepted, or, if no time was ﬁxed for acceptance, then at the time
of the refusal to accept.

(a) set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction
of the price; or
(b) maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of
warranty .
(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly
and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of

(3) In the case of breach of warranty of quality , such loss is prima facie the
dif ference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer
and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty .

extinction of the price does not prevent him from maintaining an action for the
same breach of warranty if he has suf fered further damage.
