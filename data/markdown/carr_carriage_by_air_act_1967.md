of personal injury) shall have priority over any other claims.

passenger (in the case of personal injury) as to the amount of damages to which
the claimant is entitled, and any compromise so approved shall be binding on all

The Warsaw Convention with the amendments made in it by the Hague Protocol
s 5
(W ords in square brackets in both texts are words substituted for or added to the original
W arsaw Convention by Chapter I of the Hague Protocol. Chapters Il and III of the Hague
Protocol (which af fect the W arsaw Convention) are printed at the end of each text under
the heading “Additional Provisions of the Hague Protocol af fecting the W arsaw
Convention”.)
Part I
The English text
Convention
for the Uniﬁcation of certain rules relating to
international carriage by air
Chapter I
Scope — Deﬁnitions
Article 1
(1) This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or
cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage
by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.
[(2) For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international carriage
means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties,
the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a
break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories
of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High
Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of
another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party . Carriage
between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party
without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not
international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.
(3) Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the
purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been
regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon
under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not
lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of
contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.]
Article 2
(1) This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally
constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in
Article 1.
[(2) This Convention shall not apply to carriage of mail and postal packages.]
Chapter II
Documents of carriage
Section 1 — Passenger ticket
Article 3
[(1) In respect of the carriage of passengers a ticket shall be delivered containing:
Service 0730,701

(a) an indication of the places of departure and destination;
(b) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a
single High Contracting Party , one or more agreed stopping places being
within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such
stopping place;
(c) a notice to the ef fect that, if the passenger’s journey involves an ultimate
destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the
W arsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs
and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal
injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage.]
(2) The passenger ticket shall constitute prima facie evidence of the conclusion
and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of
the passenger ticket does not af fect the existence or the validity of the contract
of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this
Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger
embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does
not include the notice required by paragraph (1)(c) of this Article, the carrier
shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22.
Section 2 — Baggage check
Article 4
[(1) In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall be
delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger ticket
which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1), shall contain:
(a) an indication of the places of departure and destination;
(b) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a
single High Contracting Party , one or more agreed stopping places being
within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such
stopping place;
(c) a notice to the ef fect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination
or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the W arsaw
Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in
most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage
to baggage.
(2) The baggage check shall constitute prima facie evidence of the registration of
the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence,
irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not af fect the existence or the
validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the
rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier takes charge of the
baggage without a baggage check having been delivered or if the baggage
check (unless combined with or incorporated in the passenger ticket which
complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1)(c)) does not include
the notice required by paragraph (1)(c) of this Article, he shall not be entitled
to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph (2).]
Section 3 — Air waybill
Article 5
(1) Every carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out and
hand over to him a document called an “air waybill”; every consignor has the
right to require the carrier to accept this document.
Sch 1LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 730,702

(2) The absence, irregularity or loss of this document does not af fect the existence
or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, subject to the provisions
of Article 9, be none the less governed by the rules of this Convention.
Article 6
(1) The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in 3 original parts and be
handed over with the cargo.

signed by the consignor and by the carrier and shall accompany the cargo. The
third part shall be signed by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor
after the cargo has been accepted.
[(3) The carrier shall sign prior to the loading of the cargo on board the aircraft.]
(4) The signature of the carrier may be stamped; that of the consignor may be
printed or stamped.
(5) If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, he shall
be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary , to have done so on behalf of the
consignor.
Article 7
The carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate waybills
when there is more than one package.
Article 8
[The air waybill shall contain:
(a) an indication of the places of departure and destination;
(b) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a
single High Contracting Party , one or more agreed stopping places being
within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such
stopping place;
(c) a notice to the consignor to the ef fect that, if the carriage involves an
ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of
departure, the W arsaw Convention may be applicable and that the
Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in
respect of loss of or damage to cargo.]
Article 9
[If, with the consent of the carrier, cargo is loaded on board the aircraft without an air
waybill having been made out, or if the air waybill does not include the notice required
by Article 8, paragraph (c), the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the
provisions of Article 22, paragraph (2).]
Article 10
(1) The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and
statements relating to the cargo which he inserts in the air waybill.
[(2) The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suf fered by him,
or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the
irregularity , incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements
furnished by the consignor.]
Article 11
(1) The air waybill is prima facie evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the
receipt of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage.
Sch 1 CARRIAGE BY AIR ACT 1967
Service 0730,703

(2) The statements in the air waybill relating to the weight, dimensions and
packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are
prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity , volume
and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except
so far as they both have been and are stated in the air waybill to have been,
checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent
condition of the cargo.
Article 12
(1) Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of
carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it
at the aerodrome of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of
the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of
destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee
named in the air waybill, or by requiring it to be returned to the aerodrome of
departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to
prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any expenses
occasioned by the exercise of this right.
(2) If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier must so
inform him forthwith.
(3) If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo
without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill delivered to the
latter, he will be liable, without prejudice to his right of recovery from the
consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is
lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill.
(4) The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the
consignee begins in accordance with Article 13. Nevertheless, if the consignee
declines to accept the waybill or the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated
with, the consignor resumes his right of disposition.
Article 13
(1) Except in the circumstances set out in the preceding Article, the consignee is
entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier
to hand over to him the air waybill and to deliver the cargo to him, on payment
of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage set out in
the air waybill.
(2) Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the
consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.
(3) If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the
expiration of 7 days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the
consignee is entitled to put into force against the carrier the rights which ﬂow
from the contract of carriage.
Article 14
The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by
Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whether he is acting in his own interest or in
the interest of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed by the
contract.
Article 15
(1) Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not af fect either the relations of the consignor or the
consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights
are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee.
Sch 1LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 730,704

(2) The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express
provision in the air waybill.
[(3) Nothing in this Convention prevents the issue of a negotiable air waybill.]
Article 16
(1) The consignor must furnish such information and attach to the air waybill such
documents as are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police
before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to
the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insuf f iciency or
irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to
the fault of the carrier or his servants or agents.
(2) The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or suf f iciency
of such information or documents.
Chapter III
Liability of the carrier
Article 17
The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a
passenger or any other bodily injury suf fered by a passenger, if the accident which caused
the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the
operations of embarking or disembarking.
Article 18
(1) The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss
of, or of damage to, any registered baggage or any cargo, if the occurrence
which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.
(2) The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraph comprises
the period during which the baggage or cargo is in charge of the carrier,
whether in an aerodrome or on board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing
outside an aerodrome, in any place whatsoever.
(3) The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea
or by river performed outside an aerodrome. If, however, such a carriage takes
place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of
loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to
the contrary , to have been the result of an event which took place during the
carriage by air.
Article 19
The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers,
baggage or cargo.
Article 20
The carrier is not liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all
necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for him and them to
take such measures.
Article 21

of the injured person the Court may , in accordance with the provisions of its own law ,

accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be
awarded in the form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital value of the
said payments shall not exceed two hundred and ﬁfty thousand francs.
Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a
higher limit of liability .
(2) (a) in the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the
carrier is limited to a sum of two hundred and ﬁfty francs per
kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time
when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of
interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if
the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum
not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater
than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in delivery at
destination.
(b) in the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or
cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into
consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is
limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages
concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the
registered baggage or cargo or of an object contained therein, af fects the
value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same
air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be
taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability .
(3) As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of
the carrier is limited to ﬁve thousand francs per passenger.
(4) The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding,
in accordance with its own law , in addition, the whole or part of the court costs
and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintif f. The
foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded,
excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the

6 months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the
commencement of the action, if that is later.
(5) The sums mentioned in francs in this Article shall be deemed to refer to a
currency unit consisting of sixty ﬁve and a half milligrammes of gold of
millesimal ﬁneness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into national
currencies in round ﬁgures. Conversion of the sums into national currencies
other than gold shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the
gold value of such currencies at the date of the judgment.]
Article 23
(1) Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to ﬁx a lower limit
than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the
nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract,
which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.

damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried.]

damage to which this Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves
that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail

Contractantes, soit sur le territoire d’une seule Haute Partie Contractante si une
escale est prévue sur le territoire d’un autre Etat, même si cet Etat n’est pas une
Haute Partie Contractante. Le transport sans une telle escale entre deux points
du territoire d’une seule Haute Partie Contractante n’est pas considéré comme
international au sens de la présente Convention.

constituer pour l’application de la présente Convention un transport unique
lorsqu’il a été envisagé par les parties comme une seule opération, qu’il ait été

Schedule 2
The Guadalajara Convention
Part I
The English text
Convention,
Supplementary to the W arsaw Convention, for the uniﬁcation of certain rules relating to
international carriage by air performed by a person other than the contracting carrier.
THE ST A TES SIGNA TORY TO THE PRESENT CONVENTION
NOTING that the W arsaw Convention does not contain particular rules relating to international
carriage by air performed by a person who is not a party to the agreement for carriage
CONSIDERING that it is therefore desirable to formulate rules to apply in such circumstances
HA VE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
Article I
In this Convention:
(a) “W arsaw Convention” means the Convention for the Uniﬁcation of
Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed at W arsaw
on 12 October 1929, or the W arsaw Convention as amended at The
Hague, 1955, according to whether the carriage under the agreement
referred to in paragraph (b) is governed by the one or by the other;
(b) “contracting carrier” means a person who as a principal makes an
agreement for carriage governed by the W arsaw Convention with a
passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger
or consignor;
(c) “actual carrier” means a person, other than the contracting carrier, who,
by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, performs the whole or
part of the carriage contemplated in paragraph (b) but who is not with
respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of the
W arsaw Convention. Such authority is presumed in the absence of proof
to the contrary .
Article II
If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the
agreement referred to in Article I, paragraph (b), is governed by the W arsaw Convention,
both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in
this Convention, be subject to the rules of the W arsaw Convention, the former for the
whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, the latter solely for the carriage
which he performs.
Article III
1 The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of his servants and agents
acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage
performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting
carrier.
2 The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of his servants and agents
acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage
Service 0730,801

performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier.
Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability
exceeding the limits speciﬁed in Article 22 of the W arsaw Convention. Any
special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not
imposed by the W arsaw Convention or any waiver of rights conferred by that
Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination
contemplated in Article 22 of the said Convention, shall not af fect the actual
carrier unless agreed to by him.
Article IV
Any complaint to be made or order to be given under the W arsaw Convention to the
carrier shall have the same ef fect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the
actual carrier. Nevertheless, orders referred to in Article 12 of the W arsaw Convention
shall only be ef fective if addressed to the contracting carrier.
Article V
In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that
carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his
employment, be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which are applicable
under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent he is unless it is proved that
he acted in a manner which, under the W arsaw Convention, prevents the limits of liability
from being invoked.
Article VI
In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts
recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and
agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount
which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under
this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of
the limit applicable to him.
Article VII
In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be
brought, at the option of the plaintif f, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or
against both together or separately . If the action is brought against only one of those
carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the
proceedings, the procedure and ef fects being governed by the law of the court seised of
the case.
Article VIII
Any action for damages contemplated in Article 7 of this Convention must be brought, at
the option of the plaintif f, either before a court in which an action may be brought against
the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 28 of the W arsaw Convention, or before the
court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier is ordinarily resident or has
his principal place of business.
Article IX
1 Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the
actual carrier of liability under this Convention or to ﬁx a lower limit than that
which is applicable according to this Convention shall be null and void, but the
nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole
agreement, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.
Sch 2LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 730,802

2 In respect of the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the preceding
paragraph shall not apply to contractual provisions governing loss or damage
resulting from the inherent defeat, quality or vice of the cargo carried.
3 Any clause contained in an agreement for carriage and all special agreements
entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to
infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law
to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void.
Nevertheless, for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject
to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place in one of the jurisdictions
referred to in Article VIII.
Article X
Except as provided in Article 7, nothing in this Convention shall af fect the rights and
obligations of the two carriers between themselves.
Article XI
Until the date on which this Convention comes into force in accordance with the
provisions of Article XIII, it shall remain open for signature on behalf of any State which
at that date is a Member of the United Nations or of any of the Specialised Agencies.
