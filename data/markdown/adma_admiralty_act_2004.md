(b) if any person with a claim against the plaintif f concerning the casualty to

other property , that person may be described in that way as defendant to
the notice of proceeding and, if described in that way , is to be treated for
the purposes of this rule to have been named in the notice of proceeding

relates as the plaintif f thinks ﬁt, and must describe those defendants in the notice
of proceeding by name.

appearance, within 7 days after the time ﬁxed for appearing, the plaintif f,
without ﬁling a statement of claim, must apply to the Court by notice of motion
for an order limiting the plaintif f’s liability or, in default of such an order, for
directions as to the further proceedings in the action, and the following
provisions apply:

concerning the casualty to which the action relates; and

(b) at least 7 clear days before the hearing of the application, the motion and
every af f idavit in support of the motion must be served on any defendant
who has entered an appearance:
(c) if at the hearing of the application it appears to the Court that it is not
disputed that the plaintif f has a right to limit the plaintif f’s liability , the
Court must make a decree limiting the plaintif f’s liability and ﬁx the
amount to which the liability is to be limited:
(d) if at the hearing of the application it appears to the Court that any
defendant does not have suf f icient information to enable the defendant to
decide whether or not to dispute that the plaintif f has a right to limit the
plaintif f’s liability , the Court must:
(i) give such directions as appear to be appropriate for enabling the
defendant to obtain such information; and
(ii) adjourn the hearing.
(e) if on the hearing or resumed hearing of the application the Court does not
make a decree limiting the plaintif f’s liability , the Court must give such
directions as to the further proceedings in the action as appear to be
appropriate:
(f) any defendant who, after directions have been given under paragraph (e),
ceases to dispute the plaintif f’s right to limit the plaintif f’s liability must
immediately ﬁle a notice to that ef fect in the registry of the Court and
serve a copy on the plaintif f and on any other defendant who has entered
an appearance:
(g) if every defendant who disputes the plaintif f’s right to limit the plaintif f’s
liability serves a notice on the plaintif f under paragraph (f), the plaintif f
may apply to the Court for an order limiting the plaintif f’s liability; and
paragraphs (b) and (c) apply to an application under this paragraph as
they apply to an application under the preceding provisions of this
subclause.

names and all those persons have been served:

(i) need not be advertised; and
(ii) operates only to protect the plaintif f against claims by the persons
so named or persons claiming through or under those persons:
(b) in any case not covered by paragraph (a), any order limiting the plaintif f’s
liability:
(i) must be advertised by the plaintif f in such manner and within such
time as the order may provide; and
(ii) must ﬁx a time within which persons with claims against the
plaintif f concerning the casualty to which the action relates may
enter an appearance in the action (if they have not already done
so) and ﬁle their claims, and, in cases to which subclause (10)
applies, ﬁle a motion, if they think ﬁt, to set the order aside.
(c) the time to be allowed under paragraph (b)(ii) must, unless the Court
otherwise orders, be not less than 2 months from the latest date allowed
for the appearance of the advertisement and, after the expiration of the

action; or
(ii) if so named, was not served with the notice of proceeding and has
not entered an appearance

concerning the casualty in question and that the defendant has suf f icient
prima facie grounds for the contention that the plaintif f is not entitled to
the relief given to the plaintif f by the order:

every af f idavit in support of the application must be served on the
plaintif f and on any defendant who has entered an appearance:
(d) on the hearing of the application, the Court, if satisﬁed that the defendant
in question has a bona ﬁde claim against the plaintif f and suf f icient prima
facie grounds for the contention that the plaintif f is not entitled to the
relief given to the plaintif f by the order, must set the order aside and give
