incurred in providing those services; or

person is or was required to pay as a condition of the grant of legal aid (whether
by way of contribution or repayment).

payee (in either case in whole or in part) or may decline the application.
32 Appointed practitioner to claim for payment

provided for each hour and include (in the case of disbursements) actual

experience with comparable claims; or
