118 Restrictions on and relief against forfeiture
(1) A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso or stipulation in a lease, for
a breach of any covenant, condition, or agreement in the lease, shall not be
enforceable by action or otherwise unless and until the lessor serves on the
lessee a notice specifying the particular breach complained of, and, if the breach
is capable of remedy , requiring the lessee to remedy the breach, and in any case
requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the
lessee fails within a reasonable time thereafter to remedy the breach, if it is
capable of remedy , and to make reasonable compensation therefor in money to
the satisfaction of the lessor.
(1A) Where the lease in respect of which such a notice has been served on the lessee
has been mortgaged and the lessor has actual notice of the name and address of
the mortgagee, he shall forthwith after serving the notice on the lessee serve a
copy of the notice on the mortgagee. Failure to comply with the provisions of
this subsection shall not of itself prevent the exercise by the lessor of any right
of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso or stipulation in the lease.
(2) Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce such a right of
re-entry or forfeiture, or has re-entered without action, the lessee may , in the

otherwise instituted, apply to the Court for relief; and the Court, having regard
to the proceedings and conduct of the parties under the foregoing provisions of
this section, and to all the circumstances of the case, may grant or refuse relief,
as it thinks ﬁt; and in case of relief may grant the same on such terms (if any)
as to costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty , or otherwise, including
the granting of an injunction to restrain any like breach in the future, as the
Court in the circumstances of each case thinks ﬁt.

record thereof to be made on the lease or otherwise.

interest in the property comprised in the lease, or any part thereof, either in the

underlessee to any estate or interest in that property , upon such conditions as to
execution of any deed or other document, payment of rent, costs, expenses,
damages, compensation, the giving of security , or otherwise as the Court in the
circumstances of each case thinks ﬁt; but in no case shall any such underlessee

compensation, penalty , or otherwise as the Court in the circumstances of each
case thinks ﬁt.
(6) [Repealed]
(7) The fact that the lessor may have granted any estate or interest in the demised
land to any person other than the lessee, which estate or interest would be
defeated or prejudicially af fected by the grant of relief to the lessee, shall not
af fect the power of the Court under this section, but in any such case the Court

estate or interest and may if it thinks ﬁt assess damages or compensation to be
paid to that person in respect of the defeat of or prejudicial ef fect upon the estate
