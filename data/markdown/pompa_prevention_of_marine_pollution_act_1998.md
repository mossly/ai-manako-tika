Liability and compensation for oil pollution damage
23 Liability for pollution damage
(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), the owner of a vessel at the time
of an incident is liable for any pollution damage caused by the vessel as a result
of the incident.
(2) No liability for pollution damage is attached to the owner if he or she proves on
the balance of probabilities that the damage:
(a) resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural
phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character; or
(b) was wholly caused by an act or omission done with intent to cause
damage by a third party; or
(c) was wholly caused by the negligence or other wrongful act of any
Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights
or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function.
(3) If the owner proves on the balance of probabilities that the pollution damage
resulted wholly or partially either from an act or omission done with intent to
cause damage by the person who suf fered the damage or from the negligence of
that person, the owner may be exonerated wholly or partially from his or her
liability to such person.
(4) No claim for compensation for pollution damage may be made against the
owner otherwise than in accordance with this Part. Subject to subsection (5), no
claim for compensation for pollution damage under this Part or otherwise may
be made against:
(a) employees or agents of the owner or members of the crew:
(b) the pilot or any other person who, without being a member of the crew ,
performs services for the ship:

or on the instructions of a competent public authority:
(e) any person taking preventive measures:
(f) all employees or agents of persons mentioned in subparagraphs (c), (d),
and (e),
unless the damage resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with
the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such
damage would probably result.
(5) Nothing in this Part prejudices any right of recourse of the owner against third
parties.
24 Limitation of liability
(1) The owner of a vessel is entitled to limit his or her liability under this Part in
respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows:
(a) 3 million units of account for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage:
Service 0268,301

(b) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, for each additional unit of
tonnage, 420 units of account in addition to the amount mentioned in
subparagraph (a),
provided, however, that this aggregate amount must not in any event exceed
59.7 million units of account.
(2) The owner is not entitled to limit his or her liability under this Part if it is proved
that the pollution damage resulted from his or her personal act or omission,
committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with
knowledge that such damage would probably result.
(3) For the purpose of availing himself or herself of the beneﬁt of the limitation
provided for in subsection (1), the owner must constitute a fund for the total sum
representing the limit of his or her liability with the court or other competent
authority of any person of the Contracting States in which action is brought
under Article IX of CLC 1969 or, if no action is brought, with any court in
which an action is brought under Article IX of CLC 1969. The fund can be
constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or
other guarantee in an amount considered adequate by the court.
(4) The fund must be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts
of their established claims.
(5) If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of his or her employees or
agents or any person providing him or her insurance or other ﬁnancial security
has as a result of the incident in question, paid compensation for pollution
damage, such person acquires, up to the amount he or she has paid, by
subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed
under this Part.
(6) The right of subrogation provided for in subsection (5) may also be exercised by
a person other than those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of
compensation for pollution damage that he or she or she may have paid.
(7) Where the owner or any other person establishes that he or she may be
compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount of
compensation, with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of
subrogation under subsection (5) or (6), had the compensation been paid before
the fund was distributed, the court may order that a suf f icient sum must be
provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his or
her claim against the fund.
(8) Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacriﬁces reasonably made
by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimise pollution damage ranks equally
with other claims against the fund.
(9) The unit of account referred to in subsection (1) is the Special Drawing Right
as deﬁned by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in
subsection (1) must be converted into New Zealand currency on the basis of the
value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of
the constitution of the fund referred to in subsection (3).
(10) The value of the New Zealand currency , in terms of the Special Drawing Right,
must be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the
International Monetary Fund in ef fect on the date in question for its operations

a fund in accordance with this section on the same conditions and having the
same ef fect as if it were constituted by the owner. Such a fund may be
constituted even if, under the provisions of subsection (2), the owner is not
entitled to limit his or her liability , but its constitution does not in that case
