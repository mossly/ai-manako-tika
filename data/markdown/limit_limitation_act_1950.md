a person entitled to a beneﬁcial interest in the land or in the proceeds of sale, not

such possession to any person in whom the land is vested as tenant for life,
person having the powers of a tenant for life, or trustee, or to any person entitled
to a beneﬁcial interest in the land or the proceeds of sale.

thereof, the right of action to recover the land shall not be deemed to have
accrued to that person until his estate or interest fell into possession.
Compare: 1939 s 8 (UK)

1 month’s notice in writing shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be

determined as aforesaid:
Provided that, where any rent has subsequently been received in respect of the
tenancy , the right of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the
last receipt of rent.

of this Act, be deemed to be determined at the expiration of the ﬁrst year or
s 12 LIMIT A TION ACT 1950
Service 0241,303

other period, and accordingly the right of action of the person entitled to the
land subject to the tenancy shall be deemed to have accrued at the date of such
determination:
Provided that, where any rent has subsequently been received in respect of the
tenancy , the right of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the

run (hereafter in this section referred to as adverse possession), and, where
under the foregoing provisions of this Act any such right of action is deemed to
accrue on a certain date and no person is in adverse possession on that date, the
right of action shall not be deemed to accrue unless and until adverse possession
is taken of the land.
(2) Where a right of action to recover land has accrued, and thereafter, before the
right is barred, the land ceases to be in adverse possession, the right of action
shall no longer be deemed to have accrued and no fresh right of action shall be
deemed to accrue unless and until the land is again taken into adverse
possession.
(3) For the purposes of this section,—
(a) possession of any land subject to a rentcharge by a person (other than the
person entitled to the rentcharge) who does not pay the rent shall be
deemed to be adverse possession of the rentcharge; and

the land by virtue of the assurance, and that person or any other person
whatsoever (other than a person entitled to possession by virtue of the
settlement) is in possession of the land for a period of 12 years from the
commencement of the time at which the assurance, if it had then been executed
by the person entitled to the entailed interest, would have operated, without the
consent of any other person, to bar the issue in tail and such estates and interests
as aforesaid, then, at the expiration of that period, the assurance shall operate,
and be deemed always to have operated, to bar the issue to tail and those estates
and interests.

to the mortgage or charge comprises any future interest or any life insurance
policy which has not matured or been determined.
(4) No action to recover arrears of interest payable in respect of any sum of money
secured by a mortgage or other charge or payable in respect of proceeds of the
sale of land, or to recover damages in respect of such arrears, shall be brought

Provided that—
(a) where a prior mortgagee or other encumbrancer has been in possession of
the property charged, and an action is brought within 1 year of the
discontinuance of that possession by the subsequent encumbrancer, he
may recover by that action all the arrears of interest which fell due during
the period of possession by the prior encumbrancer or damages in respect
thereof, notwithstanding that the period exceeded 6 years:
(b) where the property subject to the mortgage or charge comprises any
future interest or life insurance policy and it is a term of the mortgage or
charge that arrears of interest shall be treated as part of the principal sum
of money secured by the mortgage or charge, interest shall not be deemed
to become due before the right to receive the principal sum of money has
accrued or is deemed to have accrued.
