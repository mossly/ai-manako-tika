of the contract and may allow to the company or to the other parties to the
contract, as the case requires, compensation for the loss or damage sustained by
either of them which may result from the action of the Court in setting aside and

obtained; and
(h) subject to forfeiture by the company in the circumstances or in the event
provided in the articles or in terms of issue of the shares:
Provided—
(i) that the articles shall not be altered to make shares subject to

event of their so doing, any alteration to that ef fect shall be void;
and
(ii) that a forfeiture or, where there have been previous forfeitures, the
last forfeiture shall not be ef fective for any purpose if it by itself
or in any combination with any other forfeiture results in the
reduction of the number of members of the company to less than
permitted by this Act;

the last forfeiture shall not be ef fective if the forfeiture by itself or in

note holders has consented, in advance or otherwise, to the
forfeiture — in which event, upon the forfeiture of the shares each
convertible note held by the consenting convertible note holder
shall be deemed to have been automatically converted into an

and subject to all of the obligations and liabilities as a holder of an
ordinary share in the company and no fresh issue of an ordinary
share shall be necessary; or
(ii) at the time of the forfeiture the international company had on issue
one or more T able B debentures and did not have on issue any
convertible notes, and one or more of the debenture holders has
consented, in advance or otherwise, to the forfeiture — in which
event, upon the forfeiture of the shares the debentures shall be
deemed to have been automatically converted into 1 ordinary
share in the international company for every $1 secured by the
said debenture and the debenture holders shall be entitled to all of
the beneﬁts and rights and subject to all of the obligations and
liabilities as a holder of ordinary shares in the company and no
fresh issue of those ordinary shares shall be necessary or be
deemed to have been made:

with the provisions of section 54A.

cancellation of such shares, and a statement of cancellation shall be ﬁled as
provided in this Act and thereupon such shares shall be restored to the status of

Where an international company has purported to issue or allot shares and the
issue or allotment of those shares was invalid by reason of any provision of this
Act or of the memorandum or articles of the company or otherwise or the terms
of issue or allotment were inconsistent with or unauthorised by any such
provision the Registrar may , upon application lodged with him or her by the
company or by a holder or mortgagee of any of those shares or by a creditor of
the company and upon being satisﬁed that in all the circumstances it is just and
equitable so to do, make an order validating the issue or allotment of those
shares or conﬁrming the terms of issue or allotment thereof or both subject to
such conditions, if any , as he or she may impose and upon such order being
made and a copy thereof being lodged by the company or by such holder,
mortgagee or creditor with the Registrar those shares shall be deemed to have
been validly issued or allotted upon the terms of issue or allotment thereof as
varied by the conditions, if any , imposed by the Registrar.
54 Special resolution for reduction of share capital
(1) Subject to conﬁrmation by the Registrar, an international company may , if so
authorised by its articles, by special resolution, reduce its share capital in any
way and, in particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may do
all or any of the following:—
(a) extinguish or reduce the liability of any of the shares in respect of share
capital not paid up:
s 54 INTERNA TIONAL COMP ANIES ACT 1981–82
Service 072,103

(b) cancel any paid up capital which is lost or unrepresented by available
assets:
(c) repay any paid up share capital which is in excess of the needs of the
company or which it is otherwise in the interests of the company as a
whole to have paid of f,
and may , so far as necessary , alter its memorandum by reducing the amount of
its share capital and of its shares accordingly .
(2) Where the proposed reduction of share capital involves limitation of liability in
respect of unpaid share capital or the payment to any shareholder of any paid up
share capital, and in any other case if the Registrar so directs—
(a) every creditor of the international company who, at the time ﬁxed by the
Registrar, is entitled to any debt or claim which, if that date were the
commencement of the winding-up of the company would be admissible
in proof against the company , shall be entitled to object to the reduction:
(b) the Registrar, unless satisﬁed by statutory declaration that there are no
such creditors, shall settle a list of creditors so entitled to object and for
that purpose shall ascertain as far as possible without requiring an
application from any creditor the names of those creditors and the nature
and the amount of their debts or claims, and may publish notices ﬁxing a
ﬁnal day on or before which creditors not entered on the list may claim
to be so entered:
(c) where a creditor entered on the list whose debt is not discharged or whose
claim has not been determined does not consent to the reduction, the
Registrar may dispense with the consent of that creditor on the
international company securing payment of his or her debt or claim by
appropriating as the Registrar directs—
(i) if the company admits the full amount of the debt or claim or
although not admitting it is willing to provide for it, the full
amount of the debt or claim; or
(ii) if the company does not admit and is not willing to provide for the
full amount of the debt or claim or if the amount is contingent or
not ascertained, an amount ﬁxed by the Registrar.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) the Registrar may , having
regard to the circumstances of the case, direct that all or any of the provisions
of that subsection shall not apply as regards any class of creditors.
(4) All applications to the Registrar under the provisions of subsections (2) and (3)
shall be lodged with the Registrar and the international company making such
application shall bear the costs of any enquiry and advertisement directed by the
Registrar under the provisions of those subsections.
(5) The Registrar, if satisﬁed with respect to every creditor who under
subsection (2) is entitled to object that either his or her consent to the reduction
has been obtained or his or her debt or claim has been discharged or has
determined or has been secured, may make an order conﬁrming the reduction on
such terms and conditions as the Registrar thinks ﬁt and may by order require
the international company to publish as the Registrar directs the reasons for
reduction or such other information as the Registrar thinks expedient, and, if the
Registrar thinks ﬁt, the causes which led to the reduction.
(6) An order made under subsection (5) shall show the amount of the share capital
of the international company as altered by the order, the number of shares into
s 54LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 72,104

which it is to be divided and the amount of each share and the amount, if any ,
at the date of the order deemed to be paid up on each share.
(7) A copy of the order made by the Registrar conﬁrming a resolution for reducing
share capital shall be lodged by the international company with the Registrar
together with the prescribed fee and on the ﬁling of the copy of the order the
reduction of share capital conﬁrmed by that order shall take ef fect.
(8) A certiﬁcate of the Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that all the
requirements of this Act with respect to reduction of share capital have been
complied with and that the share capital of an international company is as stated
in the order.
(9) On the ﬁling of the copy of an order the particulars shown in the order pursuant
to subsection (6) shall be deemed to be substituted for the corresponding
particulars in the memorandum and such substitution and any addition ordered
by the Registrar to be made in the name of the international company shall, in
the case of any addition to the name, for such period as is speciﬁed in the order
of the Registrar, be deemed to be an alteration of the memorandum for the
purposes of this Act.
(10) A member, past or present, shall not be liable in respect of any share, to any call
or contribution exceeding in amount the dif ference between the amount of the
share as ﬁxed by the order and the amount paid, or the reduced amount which
is to be deemed to have been paid, on the share, as the case may be. Where any
creditor entitled to object to the reduction is not entered on the list of creditors,
by reason of his or her ignorance of the proceedings for reduction or of their
nature and ef fect upon his or her claim, and after the reduction the international
company is unable to pay the amount of his or her debt or claim within 1 year
after the debt or claim becomes due and payable or 1 year after the date of
reduction whichever is the later then—
(a) every person who was a member of that international company at the date
of the registration of the order for reduction is liable to contribute for the
payment of that debt or claim an amount not exceeding the amount which
he or she would have been liable to contribute if the company had
commenced to be wound up on the day before the date of the registration
of the order for reduction; and
(b) if that international company is wound up by the Court on an application
by any such creditor, then upon proof of his or her ignorance of the
proceedings for reduction or of their nature and ef fect upon his or her
claim, the Court may settle a list of persons so liable to contribute, and
make and enforce calls and orders on the contributories in a winding-up,
but nothing in this subsection shall af fect the rights of the contributories among
themselves.
(11) Any of f icer of any international company who—
(a) wilfully conceals the name of any creditor entitled to object to the
reduction; or
(b) wilfully misrepresents the nature or the amount of the debt or claim of
any creditor; or
(c) is party to any such concealment or misrepresentation—

amount of such debt or claim.

54A Capital maintenance
(1) Except insofar as this section otherwise provides, a capital return may be
ef fected by any international company (whether or not the company may elect
to alter its memorandum by reducing the amount of its share capital and its
shares accordingly) and any capital return shall be a valid act of that company
and shall be binding and enforceable against it if at the time of ef fecting the
capital return, its directors have a reasonable belief that neither the ef fecting of
that capital return nor (in the case of any capital return the performance of which
is deferred) its performance will result in the company being incapable of
meeting its existing obligations to its existing creditors as they fall due.
(2) Any capital return, if it has the ef fect of returning assets to some but not all of
the shareholders of the company (or to some but not all of the holders of any
class of shares in the company) shall except insofar as it is ef fected in
accordance with the rights of the members as stated or provided for in the
Articles of the company , be deemed to be a variation of those rights to which the
shareholders may object and the provisions of section 55 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to such deemed variation. In the case of any variation or deemed
variation not ef fected in accordance with the rights of the members as stated or
provided for in the Articles, the company shall serve a copy of the return notice
on every shareholder and any application under section 55 shall be lodged
within 28 days after the date on which that notice was served or within such
further time as the Registrar may allow .
(3) Where any capital return is ef fected otherwise than in accordance with the

expiration of a period, however long, notwithstanding any rule of law or equity

deed, the security for a debenture issued by an international company which is
irredeemable or redeemable only on the happening of a contingency shall, if the
Court so orders, be enforceable forthwith or at such other time as the Court
directs if, on the application of the trustee for the holder of the debenture or,
where there is no trustee, on the application of the holder of the debenture, the
Court is satisﬁed that—
(a) at the time of the issue of the debenture the assets of the international
company which constituted or were intended to constitute the security
therefor were suf f icient to discharge the principal debt and any interest
thereon; and
(b) the security , if realised under the circumstances existing at the time of the
application, would be likely to bring not more than 60 per centum of the
principal sum of money outstanding, regard being had to all prior charges
and charges ranking pari passu , if any; and
(c) the assets covered by the security , on a fair valuation on the basis of a
going concern, after allowing a reasonable amount for depreciation are
worth less than the principal sum and the international company is not
making suf f icient proﬁt to pay the interest due on the principal sum or,
where no deﬁnite rate of interest is payable, interest thereon at such rate
as the Court considers would be a fair rate to expect from a similar
investment.

compromise or arrangement created by the terms of a debenture or the relevant
trust deed or under a compromise or arrangement between the international
company and its creditors.

other act, manifested its intention that the debentures shall be cancelled,
that company shall have power to reissue the debentures, either by reissuing the
same debentures or by issuing other debentures in their place, but the reissue of
a debenture or the issue of one debenture in place of another under this

deemed always to have had the same priorities as if the debentures had never
been redeemed.

advances on current accounts or otherwise the debentures shall not be deemed
to have been redeemed by reason only of the account of the company having
ceased to be in debt while the debentures remain so deposited.

to provide for the full amount of the debt or claim or if the amount

for the time being unpaid if the directors think ﬁt to enforce payment of such interest, but his
liability shall cease to the extent that the company receives payment of money on respect of the
shares.

to the share be af fected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the
forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.
52. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any
