Where a range of ODPs is indicated, the highest ODP value in that range shall be used for
the purposes of the Protocol. The ODPs listed as a single value have been determined
from calculations based on laboratory measurements. Those listed as a range are based on
estimates and are less certain. The range pertains to an isomeric group. The upper value
is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the highest ODP , and the lower value is the
estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the lowest ODP .

safety of a vessel or installation or for the purpose of saving life, and the
discharge was a reasonable step to take, including with regard to the
extent of the discharge, to ef fect that purpose; or
(b) the waste or other matter escaped as a consequence of damage to the
vessel, or to any equipment used in connection with any recovery
operations, and—
(i) the damage occurred without the negligence or a deliberate act of
the licence holder (or their employees and contractors); and
(ii) as soon as practicable after the damage occurred, all reasonable
steps were taken by the licence holder to prevent the escape of the
waste or other matter or, if any escape could not be prevented, to
minimise the escape.
