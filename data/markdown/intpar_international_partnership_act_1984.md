as newly constituted.

property are partners as to proﬁts made by the use of that land or estate, and
purchase other land or estate out of the proﬁts to be used in like manner, the land

contrary , not as partners, but as co-owners for the same respective estates and
interest as are held by them in the land or estate ﬁrst mentioned at the date of the
purchase.
31 Property bought with partnership money
Unless the contrary intention appears, property bought with money belonging to
the ﬁrm is deemed to have been bought on account of the ﬁrm.

Where land has become partnership property it must, unless the contrary
s 26LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 150,604

intention appears, be treated as between the partners (including the

deceased partner and his executors or administrators as personal and not real
estate.

debt
(1) A writ of execution must not issue against any partnership property except on a
judgement against the ﬁrm.

the partnership property and proﬁts with payment of the amount of the
judgement debt and interest thereon; and may by the same or a subsequent order
appoint a receiver of that partner’s share of proﬁts (whether already declared or
accuring), and of any other money coming to that partner in respect of the
partnership, and direct all accounts and inquiries and give all other orders and
directions which might have been directed or given if the charge had been made
in favour of the judgement creditor by the partner, or which the circumstances
of the case require.
(3) The other partner or partners are at liberty at any time to redeem the interest
charged or, in case of a sale being directed, to purchase the same.

relation to the partnership, must be determined, subject to any agreement

or by the representatives of the deceased partner or its liquidator.

assignee, during the continuance of the partnership, to interfere in the
management or administration of the partnership business or af fairs, or to
require any account of the partnership transactions or to inspect the partnership
books, but entitles the assignee only to receive the share of proﬁts to which the
assigning partner would otherwise be entitled and obliges the assignee to
indemnify the assigning partner for losses of the partnership in respect of the
s 40 INTERNA TIONAL P AR TNERSHIP ACT 1984
Service 0150,901

share or part share assigned which the assigning partner would otherwise be
obliged to meet but for the assignment and the assignee must accept the account
of proﬁts or losses agreed to by the partners.
(4) In case of a dissolution of the partnership, whether as respects all the partners or
as respects the assigning partner, the assignee is entitled to receive the share of
the partnership assets to which the assigning partner is entitled as between
