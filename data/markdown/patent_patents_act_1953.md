one of those applications, the priority date of that claim shall be the date of the
relevant application for protection.
(5) Where, under the foregoing provisions of this section, any claim of a complete
speciﬁcation would, but for this provision, have two or more priority dates, the
priority date of that claim shall be the earlier or earliest of those dates.

claim shall be the date of ﬁling of the complete speciﬁcation.
Compare: 1949 s 5 (UK), 1921–22 No 18 s 8

Compulsory Licences, etc
46 Compulsory endorsement
(1) At any time after the expiration of 3 years from the date of the sealing of a
patent, any person interested may apply to the Commissioner upon any one or
more of the grounds speciﬁed in subsection (2) for a licence under the patent or
for the endorsement of the patent with the words “licences of right”.
(2) The grounds upon which application may be made for an order under this
section are as follows, that is to say:
(a) that the patented invention, being capable of being commercially worked
in New Zealand, is not being commercially worked therein or is not being
so worked to the fullest extent that is reasonably practicable:
(b) that a demand for the patented article in New Zealand is not being met on
reasonable terms:
(c) that the commercial working of the invention in New Zealand is being
prevented or hindered by the importation of the patented article:
(d) that by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a licence or licences
on reasonable terms—
(i) a market for the export of the patented article manufactured in
New Zealand is not being supplied; or
(ii) the working or ef f icient working in New Zealand of any other
patented invention which makes a substantial contribution to the
art is prevented or hindered; or
(iii) the establishment or development of commercial or industrial
activities in New Zealand is unfairly prejudiced:
(e) that by reason of conditions imposed by the patentee upon the grant of
licences under the patent, or upon the purchase, hire, or use of the
patented article or process, the manufacture, use, or sale of materials not
protected by the patent, or the establishment or development of
commercial or industrial activities in New Zealand is unfairly prejudiced.
(3) Subject as hereinafter provided, the Commissioner may , if satisﬁed that any of
the grounds aforesaid are established, make an order in accordance with the
application; and where the order is for the grant of a licence, it may require the
licence to be granted upon such terms as the Commissioner thinks ﬁt:
Provided that—
(a) where the application is made on the ground that the patented invention
is not being commercially worked in New Zealand or is not being worked
to the fullest extent that is reasonably practicable, and it appears to the
Commissioner that the time which has elapsed since the sealing of the
patent has for any reason been insuf f icient to enable it to be so worked,
he may by order adjourn the application for such period as will in his
opinion give suf f icient time for the invention to be so worked:
(b) an order shall not be made under this section for the endorsement of a
patent on the ground that a market for the export of the patented article
is not being supplied, and any licence granted under this section on that
ground shall contain such provisions as appear to the Commissioner to be
expedient for restricting the countries in which the patented article may
be sold or used by the licensee:
(c) no order shall be made under this section in respect of a patent on the
ground that the working or ef f icient working in New Zealand of another
s 46 P A TENTS ACT 1953
Service 0816,301

patented invention is prevented or hindered unless the Commissioner is
satisﬁed that the patentee in respect of that other invention is able and
willing to grant to the patentee and his licensees a licence in respect of
that other invention on reasonable terms.
(4) An application under this section may be made by any person notwithstanding
that he is already the holder of a licence under the patent; and no person shall
be estopped, from alleging any of the matters speciﬁed in subsection (2) by
reason of any admission made by him, whether in such a licence or otherwise,
or by reason of his having accepted such a licence.
(5) In this section the expression patented article includes any article made by a
patented process.

47 Provisions as to licences under section 46
(1) Where the Commissioner is satisﬁed, on application made under section 46, that
the manufacture, use, or sale of materials not protected by the patent is unfairly
prejudiced by reason of conditions imposed by the patentee upon the grant of

may , subject to the provisions of that section, order the grant of licences under
the patent to such customers of the applicant as he thinks ﬁt as well as to the
applicant.
(2) Where an application under section 46 is made by a person who is holder of a
licence under the patent, the Commissioner may , if he makes an order for the
grant of a licence to the applicant, order the existing licence to be cancelled, or
may , if he thinks ﬁt, instead of making an order for the grant of a licence to the
applicant, order the existing licence to be amended.
(3) Where on an application under section 46 the Commissioner orders the grant of
a licence, he may direct that the licence shall operate—
(a) to deprive the patentee of any right which he may have as patentee to
make, use, exercise, or vend the invention or to grant licences under the
patent:
(b) to revoke all existing licences in respect of the invention.
(4) Section 44(3) shall apply to any licence granted in pursuance of an order under

48 Exercise of powers on applications under section 46
(1) The powers of the Commissioner upon an application under section 46 shall be
exercised with a view to securing the following general purposes, that is to say:
(a) that inventions which can be worked on a commercial scale in New
Zealand and which should in the public interest be so worked shall be
worked therein without undue delay and to the fullest extent that is
reasonably practicable:
(b) that the inventor or other person beneﬁcially entitled to a patent shall
receive reasonable remuneration, having regard to the nature of the
invention:
(c) that the interests of any person for the time being working or developing
an invention in New Zealand under the protection of a patent shall not be
unfairly prejudiced.

(2) Subject to subsection (1), the Commissioner shall, in determining whether to
make an order pursuance of any such application, take account of the following
matters, that is to say:
(a) the nature of the invention, the time which has elapsed since the sealing
of the patent, and the measures already taken by the patentee or any
licensee to make full use of the invention; and
(b) the ability of any person to whom a licence would be granted under the

subsection (2).
(2) Unless in any action brought by virtue of this section the defendant proves that
the acts in respect of which proceedings were threatened constitute or, if done,
would constitute an infringement of a patent or of rights arising from
publication of a complete speciﬁcation in respect of a claim of the speciﬁcation
not shown by the plaintif f to be invalid, the plaintif f shall be entitled to the
following relief, that is to say:

written acknowledgment to the ef fect of the declaration claimed, and has
furnished him with full particulars in writing of the process or article in

shall not be deemed to imply that the patent is valid.
(4) Proceedings for a declaration may be brought by virtue of this section at any
time after the date of the publication of the complete speciﬁcation in pursuance
of an application for a patent, and references in this section to the patentee shall

Pursuant to the Patents Act 1953, His Excellency the Governor-General, acting by and
with the advice and consent of the Executive Council, hereby makes the following
regulations.
1
These regulations may be cited as the Patents (United States of America)
Regulations 1956.
2
Where an invention has been communicated to the New Zealand Government or
any individual, ﬁrm, or corporation in New Zealand at the request of that
Government under the conditions set out in an agreement between New Zealand
and the United States of America for the security of military information, and an
application for a patent for the same invention is made by the person from
whom the invention has been so communicated or by the personal
representative or assignee of that person, then—
(a) the communication, or the publication, making, use, exercise, or vending
of the inventions in consequence of the communication, shall not
prejudice the application for a patent or invalidate the grant of a patent
thereon; and
(b) the application, and any patent granted thereon, shall have priority over
any other application for a patent for the invention or any part thereof if
that other application was made by a person who obtained the invention
or part thereof in consequence of such communication as aforesaid, in the
manner and to the extent set out in regulation 4 hereof.
3
A claim to protection and priority under regulation 2 shall be addressed in
writing to the Commissioner of Patents, and may be made at any time before the
acceptance of the complete speciﬁcation ﬁled in connection with the application
for a patent but not later than 12 months from the date of the ﬁling of the
application for to patent, and shall be accompanied by a statutory declaration
giving information as to the date on which and the person to whom the invention
was communicated and a description of the information or article
communicated. The claim and declaration shall be open to public inspection on
acceptance of the complete speciﬁcation, as a notice that priority as of the date
of communication is claimed, but the notice shall not in itself be deemed to
indicate that the claim to priority has been proved to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner; and in any proceedings under the Patents Act 1953 or the
Patents Regulations 1954 the Commissioner or the Court may require the
applicant or the patentee, as the case may be to furnish such further proof as he
or it may deem necessary . When the claim is laid open to public inspection, the
date of communication claimed shall be advertise in the Journal and, on the
grant of a patent on the application, shall be entered on the register of patents.
4
When a claim to priority is made pursuant to regulation 3 hereof and any claim
of the speciﬁcation of the invention forming the subject of the application or
patent is for the same subject-matter as that claimed in a claim of the
speciﬁcation of any other application for a patent which when granted would
have a priority date within the meaning of section 11 of the Patents Act 1953
reg 4 P A TENTS (UNITED ST A TES OF AMERICA) REGULA TIONS 1956
Service 0917,001

later than the date of the communication but not later than the priority date of
any claim of the speciﬁcation of the patent applied for with the said claim to
priority , the Commissioner or the Court, as this case may be, may on satisfactory
proof of communication of the intention, treat the date of communication as the
date priority date in any proceedings under the Patents Act 1953 or the Patents
Regulations 1954—
(a) based on prior publication of or claiming of the invention in such other
application or patent; or
(b) based on prior claiming in the application or patent in respect of which
the claim to priority has been made of the invention claimed in the other
application or patent—
if the invention or part thereof claimed in the other application or patent was
obtained in consequence of that communication:
Provided that the invention or part shall be presumed to have been obtained in
consequence of the communication unless that the applicant or the patentee of
the other application or patent proves that the invention part was made in New
Zealand before the date of communication of was independently devised in New
Zealand.
5
(1) In the case of an application by any individual, ﬁrm, or corporation resident or
carrying on business in the United States of America at any time subsequent to
2 September 1952, or the personal representative or assignee of such an
individual, ﬁrm, or corporation, for a patent which if granted would have claims
in the relative speciﬁcation having a priority date subsequent to
2 September 1952, there shall be included, among the grounds upon which
notice of opposition to the grant of the patent may be given or an application for
revocation of a patent granted thereon may be made, the ground that the
invention or some part thereof was obtained in consequence of communication
by or at the request of the New Zealand Government to the Government of the
United States of America or to any person, ﬁrm, or corporation in the United
States of America under an agreement between the two Governments.
(2) For the purposes of this regulation an invention shall be presumed to have been
obtained in consequence of the communication if the priority date of any claim
of the speciﬁcation ﬁled in relation thereto is later than the date of the
communication unless the applicant or the patentee, as the case may be, proves
that he or the person from whom his title to the invention is derived introduced
the invention or a part thereof into New Zealand before the date of the
communication or devised the invention or a part thereof in New Zealand.
These regulations are administered by the Department of Justice.
