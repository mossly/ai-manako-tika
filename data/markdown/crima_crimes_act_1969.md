justiﬁcation or excuse for any act or omission, or a defence to any charge,

by him or her when under the age of 10 years.

(1) No person may be convicted of an of fence by reason of any act done or omitted
by him or her when of the age of 10 but under the age of 14 years, unless he or

until the contrary is proved.

the commonly accepted standards of right and wrong.

committed by him.

circumstances to issue such a warrant, the sentence passed or process or warrant
issued is suf f icient to justify the execution of it by every of f icer, Superintendent,

them, notwithstanding that—

acted as such a court under colour of having some appointment or

ignorance or negligence he or she believed that the warrant or process was good
in law; and ignorance of the law is in this case an excuse.
(2) It is a question of law whether the facts of which there is evidence do or do not
constitute culpable ignorance or negligence in his or her so believing the
warrant or process to be good in law .
