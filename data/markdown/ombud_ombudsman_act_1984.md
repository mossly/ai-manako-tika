interest or in the interest of any person or department or organisation, to publish
reports relating generally to the exercise of his or her functions under this Act or
to any particular case or cases investigated by him, whether or not the matters
to be dealt with in any such report have been the subject of a report to
Parliament under this Act.

by any person in custody on a charge or after conviction of any of fence, or by

remedy or right of appeal, other than the right to petition Parliament, to
which it would have been reasonable for the complainant to resort; or
(b) refuse to investigate any such complaint further if in the course of the
investigation of the complaint it appears to him or her that, having regard
to all the circumstances of the case, any further investigation is
unnecessary .
(2) Without limiting the generality of the powers conferred on the Ombudsman by
this Act, it is hereby declared that the Ombudsman may in his or her discretion
decide not to investigate, or, as the case may require, not to investigate further,

documents or papers or things which in the Ombudsman’s opinion relate to any
such matter as aforesaid and which may be in the possession or under the

provisions of any enactment, other than the Public Service Act 1975 and the

any matter is required to supply any information to or answer any question put
by an Ombudsman in relation to that matter, or to produce to an Ombudsman
any document or paper or thing relating to it, if compliance with that
requirement would be in breach of the obligation of secrecy or non-disclosure.
(4) With the previous consent in writing of any complainant, any person to whom
subsection (3) applies may be required by the Ombudsman to supply
s 15LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS

the purposes of this section, the person is entitled to the same fees, allowances,
and expenses as if the Ombudsman were a witness in a court, and the provisions

accordingly . For the purposes of this subsection the Ombudsman has the powers
of the court under any such regulations to ﬁx or disallow , in whole or in part, or
increase the amounts payable thereunder.
17 Disclosure of certain matters not to be required
(1) Where the Minister of Justice certiﬁes that the giving of any information or the
answering of any question or the production of any document or paper or
thing—
(a) might prejudice the security , defence, or international relations of the
Cook Islands (including the Cook Islands relations with the Government
of any other country or with any international organisation), or the
investigation or detection of of fences; or
(b) might involve the disclosure of the deliberations of Cabinet; or
(c) might involve the disclosure of proceedings of Cabinet or of any
committee of Cabinet, relating to matters of a secret or conﬁdential
nature, and would be injurious to the public interest—
the Ombudsman must not require the information or answer to be given or, as
the case may be, the document or paper or thing to be produced.
(2) Subject to subsection (1), the rule of law which authorises or requires the
withholding of any document or paper, or the refusal to answer any questions on
the ground that the disclosure of the document or paper or the answering of the
question would be injurious to the public interest does not apply in respect of
any investigation by or proceedings before the Ombudsman.
18 Ombudsman and staf f to maintain secrecy
(1) The Ombudsman and every person holding any of f ice or appointment under the
Ombudsman is deemed for the purposes of the Of f icial Secrets Act 1951 to be

giving ef fect to this Act.
(4) Despite anything in the foregoing provisions of this section the Ombudsman
may disclose such matters as in his or her opinion ought to be disclosed for the

investigation under this Act, an Ombudsman is of opinion that the decision,
recommendation, act, or omission which was the subject-matter of the
investigation—

(b) was unreasonable, unjust, oppressive, or improperly discriminatory , or
was in accordance with a rule of law or a provision of any Act,
regulation, or bylaw or a practice that is or may be unreasonable unjust,
oppressive, or improperly discriminatory; or
(c) was based wholly or partly on a mistake of law or fact; or
(d) was wrong.
(2) The provisions of this section also apply in any case where the Ombudsman is
of the opinion that in the making of the decision or recommendation, or in the
doing or omission of the act, a discretionary power has been exercised for an
improper purpose or on irrelevant grounds or on the taking into account of
irrelevant considerations, or that, in the case of a decision made in the exercise
of any discretionary power, reasons should have been given for the decision.
(3) If in any case to which this section applies the Ombudsman is of the opinion—
(a) that the matter should be referred to the appropriate authority for further
consideration; or
(b) that the omission should be rectiﬁed; or
(c) that the decision should be cancelled or varied; or
(d) that any practice on which the decision, recommendation, act, or
omission was based should be altered; or
(e) that any law on which the decision, recommendation, act, or omission
was based should be reconsidered; or

to the appropriate department or organisation, and may make such
s 18LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 1 685,504

recommendations as he or she thinks ﬁt. In any such case the Ombudsman may
request the department or organisation to notify him, within a speciﬁed time, of
the steps (if any) that it proposes to take to give ef fect to the Ombudsman’s
recommendations. The Ombudsman must also, in the case of an investigation
relating to a department or organisation named or speciﬁed in Part 1 of the
schedule, send a copy of his or her report or recommendations to the Minister
concerned, and, in the case of an investigation relating to an organisation named
or speciﬁed in Part 2 of the schedule, send a copy of the report or
recommendation to the chairperson of the organisation concerned and to the
Minister, if any .
(4) If within a reasonable time after the report is made no action is taken which
seems to an Ombudsman to be adequate and appropriate, the Ombudsman, in
his or her discretion, after considering the comments (if any) made by or on
behalf of any department or organisation af fected, may send a copy of the report
and recommendations to the Prime Minister, and may thereafter make such
report to Parliament on the matter as he or she thinks ﬁt.
(5) The Ombudsman must attach to every report sent or made under subsection (4)
a copy of any comments made by or on behalf of the department or organisation
af fected.
(6) Despite anything in this section the Ombudsman must not, in any report made
under this Act, make any comment that is adverse to any person unless the
person has been given an opportunity to be heard.
20 Ombudsman may require publication of summary of report
(1) Where an Ombudsman has prepared a report under section 19(3) relating to any
organisation named or speciﬁed in Part 2 of the Schedule, the Ombudsman may
prepare and send to the principal administrative of f icer of that organisation a
written summary of the contents of his or her report and require that of f icer to
make copies of that summary available during ordinary business hours for
inspection by members of the public without charge. Any member of the public
may make a copy of the whole or any part of the summary .
(2) Before forwarding any such written summary to the appropriate principal
administrative of f icer under subsection (1), the Ombudsman must send a copy of
it in draft form to the organisation to which it relates for perusal, and must, as
far as practicable, incorporate in the summary any comments made to him or her
by the organisation.
(3) Within 1 week after the report is received by the organisation, the principal
administrative of f icer of that organisation must, at the expense of the
organisation, give public notice in such form and in such newspapers as the
Ombudsman requires of the availability of the report for inspection and of the
places where it may be inspected.
(4) Every such report must be made available for a period of 4 weeks from the date
of the ﬁrst publication of the public notice.
