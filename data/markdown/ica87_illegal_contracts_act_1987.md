Service 0600,301

the creation or performance of the contract; and includes a contract which
contains an illegal provision, whether the provision is severable or not.
4 Breach of enactment
A contract lawfully entered into does not become illegal or unenforceable by
any party by reason of the fact that its performance is in breach of any
enactment, unless the enactment expressly so provides or its object clearly so
requires.
5 Illegal contracts to be of no ef fect
Despite any rule of law or equity to the contrary , but subject to the provisions
of this Act and of any other enactment, every illegal contract is of no ef fect and
no person is entitled to any property under a disposition made by or pursuant to
any such contract:
Provided that nothing in this section invalidates—
(a) any disposition of property by a party to an illegal contract for valuable
consideration; or
(b) any disposition of property made by or through a person who became
entitled to the property under a disposition to which paragraph (a) of this
proviso applies—
if the person to whom the disposition was made was not a party to the illegal
contract and had not at the time of the disposition notice that the property was
the subject of, or the whole or part of the consideration for, an illegal contract
and otherwise acts in good faith.
6 Court may grant relief
(1) Despite the provisions of section 5, but subject to the express provisions of any
other enactment, the Court may in the course of any proceedings, or on
application made for the purpose, grant to—
(a) any party to an illegal contract; or
(b) any party to a contract who is disqualiﬁed from enforcing it by reason of
the commission of an illegal act in the course of its performance; or
(c) any person claiming through or under any such party—
such relief by way of restitution, compensation, variation of the contract,
validation of the contract in whole or part or for any particular purpose, or
otherwise howsoever as the Court in its discretion thinks just.
(2) An application under subsection (1) may be made by—
(a) any person to whom the Court may grant relief pursuant to
subsection (1):
(b) any other person where it is material for that person to know whether
relief will be granted under that subsection.
(3) In considering whether to grant relief under subsection (1), the Court must have
regard to—
(a) the conduct of the parties; and
(b) in the case of a breach of an enactment, the object of the enactment and
the gravity of the penalty expressly provided for any breach thereof; and
(c) such other matters as it thinks proper; but must not grant relief if it
considers that to do so would not be in the public interest.

(4) The Court may make an order under subsection (1) notwithstanding that the
person granted relief entered into the contract or committed an unlawful act or
unlawfully omitted to do an act with knowledge of the facts or law giving rise
to the illegality , but the Court must take such knowledge into account in
exercising its discretion under that subsection.
(5) The Court may , by any order made under subsection (1), vest any property that
was the subject of, or the whole or part of the consideration for, an illegal
contract in any party to the proceedings or may direct any such party to transfer
or assign any such property to any other party to the proceedings.
(6) Any order made under subsection (1) or any provision of any such order, may
be made upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the Court thinks ﬁt.
(7) Subject to the express provisions of any other enactment, no Court may , in
respect of any illegal contract, grant relief to any person otherwise than in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.
7 Restraints of trade
(1) Where any provision of any contract constitutes an unreasonable restraint of
trade, the Court may—
(a) delete the provision and give ef fect to the contract as so amended; or
(b) so modify the provision that at the time the contract was entered into, the
provision as modiﬁed would have been reasonable, and give ef fect to the
contract as so modiﬁed; or
(c) where the deletion or modiﬁcation of the provision would so alter the
bargain between the parties that it would be unreasonable to allow the
contract to stand, decline to enforce the contract.
(2) The Court may modify a provision under subsection (1)(b) notwithstanding that
the modiﬁcation cannot be ef fected by the deletion of words from the provision.
8 Application of Act
This Act applies to contracts whether made before or after the commencement
of this Act;
Provided that nothing in section 5 applies to contracts made before the
commencement of this Act.
