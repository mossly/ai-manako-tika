encumbrances against the land.
(5) Notwithstanding that a charge securing the repayment of an advance under
subsection (4) ranks in priority immediately before all other encumbrances, the
Minister may , on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, agree to accept a lower
ranking in order of priority .
(6) The provisions of the Property Law Act 1952 apply with respect to every such
charge as if the charge were a mortgage of the land and as if references to the
mortgagor and to mortgagee were references to the person giving the charge and
to the charge holder respectively . In particular, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing provisions of this subsection, there is implied therein on the part
of the person giving the charge the covenants by the mortgagor speciﬁed in
Schedule 4, and in favour of the charge holder the powers and conditions
speciﬁed in that Schedule.
(7) Every such charge in favour of Her Majesty the Queen may be enforced, sued
upon, varied, or released on behalf of Her Majesty by any person department or
body for the time being authorised by the Minister.
29 Child beneﬁt to be applied in repayment of advances
(1) Despite anything in this Act or any other enactment to the contrary , where an
advance is made to a beneﬁciary , each child beneﬁt in respect of which the
advance is made—
(a) in the case of advances calculated on a reduced rate of the child beneﬁt,
continues to be payable after taking into account and deducting therefrom
the reduced rate of the beneﬁt by which the advance was calculated:
(b) in the case of advances calculated on the full rate of child beneﬁt, ceases
to be payable to the beneﬁciary ,
and, continues to be so reduced or not payable, as the case may be, until the
child in respect of whom the beneﬁt is payable attains the age in respect of
which the capitalised value of the beneﬁt was calculated for the purposes of the
advance. On attainment of that age by the child, the advance, to the extent to
which it was made in respect of that beneﬁt, is deemed to have been repaid:
(c) in any case where before the child attains that age an event occurs by
reason of which the unpaid balance of the advance, or any part thereof,
s 29 WELF ARE ACT 1989
Service 0830,701

has become repayable, be applied, so long as entitlement to a beneﬁt
remains, in repayment of that balance or part and any interest payable
thereon until that balance or part and that interest are paid in full—
and thereafter, if the beneﬁt continues to be payable in respect of that child, it
must be paid to the person entitled to receive payment thereof under section 8.
(2) Where the child in respect of whom a child beneﬁt is payable dies after the
expiration of 1 year from the date of the advance and before attaining the age in
respect of which the capitalised value of the beneﬁt was calculated for the
purpose of the advance and before any event has occurred by reason of which
the unpaid balance of the advance or any part thereof has become repayable, any
advance, to the extent that it was made in respect of that beneﬁt, is deemed to
have been repaid on the death of the child.
30 Death of beneﬁciary or spouse of beneﬁciary
Where an advance is made in respect of a child beneﬁt, and the beneﬁciary and
the spouse (if any) of the beneﬁciary at the date of the advance, both die before
the child in respect of whom the beneﬁt was payable attains the age in respect
of which the capitalised value of the beneﬁt was calculated for the purposes of
the advance, and before the occurrence of any event by reason of which the
unpaid balance of the advance, or any part thereof, has become repayable, the
advance, to the extent of which it was made in respect of the child beneﬁt
payable in respect of that child, must, if the Minister so determines, be deemed
to have been repaid as at the date of the death of the beneﬁciary (in the absence
of there being a spouse of the beneﬁciary) or the date of death of the survivor
of the beneﬁciary and spouse of the beneﬁciary as the case may be.
31 Repayment of advances
(1) Subject to the provisions of section 34, the unpaid balance of an advance is
repayable upon demand signed by the charge holder or by the person or body
entitled to enforce the charge under section 28 or by any agent or servant or
clerk of the charge holder or of that person, served upon the beneﬁciary and
where necessary the spouse of the beneﬁciary , either personally or by posting
the notice in a duly registered letter addressed to them at their usual or last
known place of abode in the Cook Islands.
(2) Without limiting the circumstances in which such a demand may be made,
demand may , if the Minister so determines, be made—
(a) on the occurrence of any event (other than the death after the expiration
of 1 year from the date of the advance of a child in respect of whom the
beneﬁt was payable) by reason of which the beneﬁt or any part thereof
would have ceased to be payable to the beneﬁciary if the advance had not
been made; or
(b) on the transfer or lease or other disposition by the beneﬁciary or by the
beneﬁciary and the spouse of the beneﬁciary of the land in respect of
which the advance was made or the occurrence of any event by which the
beneﬁciary ceases to be the owner or one of the owners of the land; or
(c) on the beneﬁciary , or any child in respect of whom the beneﬁt to which
the advance relates was payable, ceasing to occupy as a home the land in
respect of which the advance was made; or
s 29LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 830,702

(d) on the conviction of the beneﬁciary or the spouse of the beneﬁciary of
any of fence against this Part or of any of fence relating to a child beneﬁt
in respect of which the advance was made.
(3) The fact that any such demand is made by the charge holder or by the person
entitled to enforce the charge under section 28 or by any agent or servant or
clerk of the charge holder or of that person is suf f icient evidence of the authority
of the charge holder or of that person, agent, servant, or clerk to make the
demand.
(4) Where the child in respect of whom a child beneﬁt was payable dies within
1 year after the date of an advance in respect of that beneﬁt, the unpaid balance
of the advance, unless it is sooner repaid by the beneﬁciary , remains charged
against the land until the repayment is required by the charge holder.
(5) For the purposes of this Part, the date of an advance is deemed to be the date on
which the child beneﬁt in respect of which the advance was made ceases to be
payable to the beneﬁciary by reason of the advance.
32 Calculation of unpaid balance of advance
For the purposes of this Part, the amount of the unpaid balance of an advance is
that amount equal to the capitalised value of the beneﬁt in respect of which it
was made for the number of pay periods of the advance less the number of pay
periods that have lapsed since the date of the advance, calculated, as if for an
advance in the ﬁrst instance, from the end of the pay period during which the
event occurred which results in the advance becoming repayable.
33 Resumption of payment of beneﬁt
Despite anything in section 29, where an advance has become repayable, the
Minister may , in his or her discretion, at any time resume payment of the beneﬁt
to such other person or persons as the Minister determines, without releasing the
beneﬁciary or the spouse of the beneﬁciary from any liability to repay the
unpaid balance of the advance and any interest payable thereon or releasing the
charge over the land owned by the beneﬁciary or the beneﬁciary and the spouse
of the beneﬁciary .
34 Repayment of advance where death of child caused by parent
(1) Despite anything in section 29 where the child in respect of whom an advance
has been made dies after the date of the advance and before attaining the age in
respect of which the capitalised value of the beneﬁt was calculated for the
purpose of the advance, and the death of the child is cause by an of fence of
which the beneﬁciary or spouse of the beneﬁciary is convicted, the Minister may
apply to a Judge for an order declaring that the unpaid balance of the advance
at the date of death of the child became repayable on that date.
(2) On any application under subsection (1) the Judge must, having regard to the
conduct of the beneﬁciary or spouse of the beneﬁciary and to all the
circumstances of the case—
(a) make an order declaring that the unpaid balance of the advance became
repayable on the death of the child; or
(b) make such other order as he or she thinks ﬁt so as to ensure that any
person who was so convicted or whose conduct, in the opinion of the
judge, contributed to the death of the child will not derive any beneﬁt
from the death of the child; or
s 34 WELF ARE ACT 1989
Service 0830,703

(c) make an order declaring that the unpaid balance of the advance is deemed
to have been repaid on the death of the child.
35 Recovery of unpaid balance
The unpaid balance of an advance that has become repayable and any interest
thereon may be recovered as a debt due to the Crown at the suit of the Minister.
36 Financial provisions
Every advance must be made, out of the Public Account, from money
appropriated by Parliament for the purpose.
37 Exemption from fees
No fee is payable under any Act in respect of registration of any document
required for the purpose of registering or releasing (whether wholly or in part)
any charge created under section 28.
38 Of fences and penalties
(1) Every person commits an of fence against this Part who—
(a) in relation to any application for an advance, whether to himself or
herself or to any other person, makes a statement knowing it to be false
in any material particular or otherwise wilfully attempts to mislead any
of f icer concerned in the administration of this Part or any other person
whomsoever; or
(b) being a beneﬁciary or the spouse of a beneﬁciary to whom an advance
has been made—

supply in writing to the Minister any information reasonably
required by the Minister for the purpose of ascertaining whether
or not the conditions on which the advance was made have been
fulﬁlled or whether or not any event has occured by reason of
which the advance of any part thereof has become repayable; or
(ii) supplies any such information knowing it to be false or misleading
in any material particular; or
(c) except in a case to which paragraph (a) or (b) applies, wilfully fails to
comply with any of the requirements of section 23(4).
