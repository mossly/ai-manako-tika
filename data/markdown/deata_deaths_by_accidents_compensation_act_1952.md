of those sections shall prevent the Court from making an order under this Part
of this Act in respect of any damages to which this Part of this Act applies.
22 V alidation of certain orders previously made
Where the Court has made an order before the commencement of this Act and
the order was invalid at the time when it was made but would have been valid
if this Part had then been in force, the order shall be deemed to have been
validly made and the provisions of this Part shall be deemed to have applied to
