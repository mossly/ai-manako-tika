(b) that, in view of the fact that the business of the society is being, or is
intended to be, conducted—
(i) mainly for the purpose of improving the conditions of living, or
otherwise promoting the social well-being, of members of the
working classes; or
s 4 INDUSTRIAL AND PROVIDENT SOCIETIES ACT 1908
Service 0760,303

(ii) otherwise for the beneﬁt of the community ,—

carries on, or intends to carry on, business with the object of making proﬁts
mainly for the payment of interest, dividends, or bonuses on money invested

notiﬁes any such society that, in his opinion, it has ceased to be a bona ﬁde
cooperative society , subsection (4) shall cease to apply to it.

deceive, except where that other society or company or body corporate,
as the case may be, signiﬁes its consent in such manner as the Registrar
requires, and the Registrar is satisﬁed that registration of the society by
the proposed name will not be contrary to the public interest:

society registered under this Act:

provisions as to registry under this Act, shall issue to such society an

may appeal from such refusal to the High Court:

(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, any provision contained in a

for breach of trust where he fails to show the degree of care and diligence
required of him as trustee, having regard to the provisions of the trust deed
conferring on him any powers, authorities, or discretion.
