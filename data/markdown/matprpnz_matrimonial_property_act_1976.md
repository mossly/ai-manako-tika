in either of which events the increase in value or the income or gains (as the case
may be) are matrimonial property .

matrimonial property .
(5) Subject to section 21, all property acquired by either the husband or the wife
after an order of the court (not being an order made under section 25(3)) has

Service 035,305

improvement of, or to increase the value of, or the amount of any interest of

s 9LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 35,306

(ii) the matrimonial home is not owned by the husband or the wife or
both of them,—
the court shall award each spouse an equal share in such part of the

12 Homesteads
[Repealed]
[Section 12: repealed, on 21 April 1992, by Schedule of the Matrimonial Property Act 1991–92
(1991–92 No 36).]
13 Marriages of short duration
(1) Where a marriage has been of short duration, sections 11 and 12 do not apply—
(a) to any asset owned wholly or substantially by one spouse at the date of
the marriage; or
(b) to any asset that has come to one spouse after the date of the marriage by
succession or by survivorship or as the beneﬁciary under a trust or by gift
from a third person; or
(c) where the contribution of one spouse to the marriage partnership has
clearly been disproportionately greater than that of the other spouse.
(2) In every case to which subsection (1) applies, the share of each spouse in the
matrimonial property must, upon the division of that property , be determined in
accordance with the contribution of each to the marriage partnership.
(3) For the purposes of this section, a marriage of short duration means a
marriage in which the spouses have lived together as husband and wife for a
period of less than 3 years (in the computation of which any period of resumed
cohabitation with the motive of reconciliation may be excluded if it lasts for not
more than 3 months) or, if the court having regard to all the circumstances of the
marriage considers it just, for a period longer than 3 years.
14 Extraordinary circumstances
Where there are extraordinary circumstances that, in the opinion of the court,
render repugnant to justice the equal sharing between the spouses of any
property to which section 11 applies or of any sum of money pursuant to
section 12, the share of each must, despite anything in section 11 or 12, be
determined in accordance with the contribution of each to the marriage
partnership.

Other provisions relating to division of matrimonial property
15 Division of balance of matrimonial property
(1) Upon the division of matrimonial property (other than property to which
section 11 or 12 applies), each spouse shall share equally in it unless his or her
contribution to the marriage partnership has been clearly greater than that of the
other spouse.
(2) Where, pursuant to subsection (1), the spouses do not share equally in the
matrimonial property or any part of the matrimonial property , the share of each
in the matrimonial property or in that part of it must be determined in
accordance with the contribution of each to the marriage partnership.
(3) This section is subject to sections 16 and 17.
[Section 15(1): amended, on 1 January 1984, by section 5 of the Matrimonial Property Amendment
Act (No 2) 1983 (1983 No 145).]
16 Adjustments may be made when each spouse owns a home at date of
marriage
Despite anything in sections 11 to 15, where, at the date of the marriage, each
spouse owned a home capable of becoming a matrimonial home, but the home
(or the proceeds of the sale thereof) of only one spouse is included in the
matrimonial property at the time when the property falls to be divided under this
Act, the court may make such adjustments to the shares of the spouses in any of
the matrimonial property (including the matrimonial home and the family
chattels) as it thinks just to compensate for the inclusion of the home of only
1 spouse in the matrimonial property .
17 Sustenance or diminution of separate property
(1) Despite anything in sections 11 to 15, where the separate property of 1 spouse
has been sustained by—
(a) the application of matrimonial property; or
(b) the actions of the other spouse,—
the court may increase the share to which the other spouse would otherwise be
entitled in the matrimonial property or order that the spouse pay to the other a
sum of money by way of compensation.
(2) Despite anything in sections 11 to 15, where the separate property of 1 spouse
has been materially diminished in value by the deliberate actions of the other
spouse, the share to which the other spouse would otherwise be entitled in the
matrimonial property may be diminished to such extent as the court thinks just.
18 Contributions of spouses
(1) For the purposes of this Act a contribution to the marriage partnership
means all or any of the following,—
(a) the care of any child of the marriage or of any aged or inﬁrm relative or
dependant of the husband or the wife:
(b) the management of the household and the performance of household
duties:
(c) the provision of money , including the earning of income, for the purposes
of the marriage partnership:
(d) the acquisition or creation of matrimonial property , including the
payment of money for those purposes:
s 18 MA TRIMONIAL PROPER TY ACT 1976
Service 035,501

(e) the payment of money to maintain or increase the value of—
(i) the matrimonial property or any part thereof; or

(i) the matrimonial property or any part thereof; or
(ii) the separate property of the other spouse or any part thereof:
(g) the forgoing of a higher standard of living than would otherwise have
been available:
(h) the giving of assistance or support to the other spouse (whether or not of
a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which—
