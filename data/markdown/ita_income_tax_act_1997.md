be made good by repair, the Collector may allow such deduction as the
Collector thinks just; and
Provided further that where the Collector is satisﬁed that any repairs of any such
asset do not increase the capital value of the asset, or that the repairs increase
that value by an amount less than the cost of the repairs or alterations, the

Collector may refuse in whole or in part to allow any deduction under that
subsection in any case where the Collector is not satisﬁed that complete and

commencement of this Act), allowed a deduction in respect of the depreciation
of any asset and the taxpayer at any time afterwards sells or otherwise disposes
of that asset at a price or for a consideration in excess of the amount to which

company over which the vendor has control, as deﬁned in section 3, or to any
partnership over which the vendor has control, the amount of the annual
deductions is limited to the amount to which the vendor would have been
entitled had the sale not taken place.
(3) Where the Collector has for any year of assessment allowed a deduction under
the provisions of this section and the taxpayer at any time afterwards sells the
unexpired period of the lease, the Collector may make a revised assessment in
respect of that year of assessment without allowing that deduction or without
allowing such portion thereof as the Collector thinks ﬁt, and may recover the
additional amount of income tax accordingly .
(4) For the purpose of giving ef fect to subsection (3), the Collector may at any time

the credit for foreign tax.

(b) that credit has not taken into account any refund or repayment of the
foreign tax received by the taxpayer, whether before or after that credit
was allowed; and
(c) the amount of that credit was in excess of the amount that would have
been allowed if only the amount of the foreign tax not refunded or repaid
to the taxpayer had been taken into account in calculating the credit,
the amount of that excess is deemed to be income tax due and payable to the
Collector on the 30th day after the date of the notice of determination of the
credit or the date of the receipt by the taxpayer of that refund or repayment,
whichever date is the later, and the provisions of this Act apply accordingly .

(2) This Part applies to salary or wages for any period on or after 1 July 1997, and
to other source deduction payments which are paid or would normally be paid
on or after that date, notwithstanding that any such other source deduction
payment may as to the whole or any part thereof be for a period before that date.
(3) If any question is raised as to whether or not a source deduction payment is as
to the whole or any part thereof subject to this Part, it must, subject to any
regulations made for the purposes of this Part, be determined by the Collector.
(4) It is a ground for objection under Part 4 to an assessment of the amount of any
tax deduction that any determination of the Collector made for the purposes of

Act 2014 (2014 No 5).]
T ax deductions
145 T ax deductions to be made by employers
(1) For the purpose of enabling the collection of income tax from employees by
instalments, where an employee receives a source deduction payment from an
employer, the employer or other person by whom the payment is made must, at
the time of making the payment, make a tax deduction therefrom in accordance
with this Part and by reference to the basic tax deductions set out in Schedule 2:
Provided that if a tax deduction is not made by the employer in any such case
section 156 applies to the employee.
(2) Where in the case of a regular full-time employment an employee receives
salary or wages from any 1 employer for part only of the pay period, that salary
or wages are deemed to be for the whole of the pay period.
(3) For the purposes of this section, where an employee receives salary or wages in
respect of work performed by the employee as a piece worker or out-worker and
the employee is paid on a production basis, that salary or wages are deemed to
be for the period from the commencement of the performance of the work until
the completion of the work.
(4) Where a source deduction payment for any pay period is paid in two or more
separate sums, all sums so paid must, for the purpose of calculating the amount
of the tax deduction, be aggregated, and the employer may at the employer’s
option, make the tax deduction wholly from one sum or in part from each of any
two or more sums:
Provided that where, by reason of the size or nature of the employer’s business
or organisation, the dispersal of employees, or dif f iculty in assembling
particulars, or for any other reason approved by the Collector, it is impracticable
Service 0693,801

for an employer to pay overtime pay for a pay period at the same time as the
other salary or wages for the pay period, the overtime pay of any employee for
the pay period may , for the purpose of calculating the amount of the tax
deduction, be aggregated with the employee’s salary or wages (other than
overtime pay) for a subsequent pay period if, in respect of both pay periods—
(a) the amounts of the employee’s salary or wages (other than overtime pay)
are substantially the same; and
(b) the amounts of the tax deductions applicable to the employee’s salary or
wages are the same; and
(c) the tax code applicable to the employee is the same:
Provided also that, where it is the practice of an employer to pay overtime pay
for an interval of time which is of the same length as a pay period of an
employee but does not coincide with any such pay period, the overtime pay of
the employee for any such interval may , for the purposes of the ﬁrst proviso to
this subsection, be deemed to be overtime pay for the pay period during which
that interval ends, if the amounts of the employee’s salary or wages (other than
overtime pay) for that interval and for that pay period are substantially the same.
[Section 145(1): amended, on 1 January 2014, by section 37(9) of the Income T ax Amendment
Act 2013 (2013 No 18).]
146 T ax deductions from amounts credited to or applied for employees
Where a source deduction payment, though not actually paid, is credited to or
applied on account of any employee entitled thereto, the amount so credited or
applied is, for the purposes of this Part, deemed to be paid when it is so credited
or applied, and a tax deduction in respect thereof must be made accordingly .
147 Beneﬁts and superannuation and other payments deemed to be salary or
wages
Where in respect of employment an employee receives or enjoys a beneﬁt
referred to in section 46(2)(b), or any other beneﬁt in kind which is included in
salary or wages, or receives a payment by way of superannuation, pension,
retiring allowance, or other allowances, or annuity which is included in salary or
wages as deﬁned in section 2, the value of the beneﬁt (whether in money or
otherwise) or, as the case be, the amount of the payment is deemed to accrue
from day to day , and accordingly in each case the amount so accrued for any
days in a pay period of the employee is deemed to be that employee’s salary or
wages for the pay period, or, as the case may be, part of that employee’s salary
or wages for the pay period.
148 Payment to be made by employee where tax deduction exceeds source
deduction payment
(1) Where, at the time when a source deduction payment is made or deemed to be
made, the amount of the source deduction payment available in money is less
than the amount of the tax deduction, or there is no amount available in money ,
the employee must forthwith pay to the employer the amount of the deﬁciency
in the tax deduction or, as the case may be, the amount of the tax deduction, and
every amount so paid on any date is deemed to be a tax deduction made by the
employer on that date from the source deduction payment made or deemed to be
made to the employee.
(2) If an employee makes default in paying to the employer any amount payable
under this section, or any part of any such amount, the amount in respect of
s 145LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 693,802

which default has been made is deemed for the purposes of section 156 to be a
tax deduction that should have been made and was not made, and the provisions
of that section apply accordingly .
149 T ax codes
(1) For the purposes of this Part, the tax code of any employee in relation to any
source deduction payment (not being a source deduction payment that is an
extra emolument and not being a source deduction payment that is a
withholding payment) must be such one of the following codes as applies to the
employee in respect of that source deduction payment in accordance with this
section; namely—
(a) no declaration , signifying an employee who has not delivered to the
employer a tax code declaration in the form authorised by the Collector
and containing such particulars as the Collector requires, nor a tax code
certiﬁcate:
(b) P, signifying an employee in relation to whom the source deduction
payment is a payment that exceeds a source deduction payment from any
other employer:
(c) S, signifying an employee in relation to whom the source deduction
payment is a payment that is less than a source deduction payment from
any other employer.
(2) Subject to this Act, where any employee desires that a reduced deduction applies
to the employee (whether or not the same or any other reduced deduction has
previously applied), the employee may deliver to the employee’s employer a tax
code declaration in a form authorised by the Collector, and containing such
particulars as the Collector requires, and specifying the employee’s tax code as
determined by those particulars, and that tax code applies to the employee in
accordance with this section.
(3) Where any employee considers that it is or will be undesirable or impracticable
for the employee to deliver a tax code declaration to the employee’s employer,
the employee may deliver the declaration to the Collector, and in any such case
the Collector must issue to the employee a tax code certiﬁcate addressed to the
employer and specifying the employee’s tax code as determined by the
particulars contained in the declaration. The employee may deliver that
certiﬁcate to the employee’s employer, and that tax code applies to the employee
in accordance with this section.
(4) When an employee has delivered a tax code declaration or a tax code certiﬁcate
to the employee’s employer, the tax code applies, subject to this Act, to the
employee in respect of all source deduction payments made by the employer to
the employee after the delivery of the declaration or certiﬁcate and before the
tax code ceases in accordance with subsection (5) or (6) to apply to the
employee:
Provided that, except in the case of salary or wages for the ﬁrst pay period of a
new employment of the employee, the tax code does not apply in respect of the
salary or wages for any pay period commencing before the date of the delivery
of the declaration or certiﬁcate to the employer.
(5) Where a tax code applies to an employee on the last day of a year, the tax code
does not apply to the employee in respect of any source deduction payment
s 149 INCOME T AX ACT 1997
Service 0693,803

made by the employer to the employee after that day , not being a payment of
salary or wages for a pay period current on that day:
Provided that where there is no change in the tax code of the employee and the
employee delivers a further tax code declaration or tax code certiﬁcate to the
employer not later than 10 days after 1 January in the next year, the tax code
speciﬁed in that declaration or certiﬁcate is deemed to have commenced to
apply to the employee immediately after the former tax code ceased to apply to
the employee.
(6) Where an employee, being an employee to whom a P or S tax code previously
applied, ceases to be entitled to the use of that tax code, the tax code does not
apply to the employee in respect of any source deduction payment made by the
employer to the employee after the date on which that entitlement so ceased, not
being a payment of salary or wages for a pay period current on that date:
Provided that where the employee delivers a further tax code declaration or tax
code certiﬁcate to the employer not later than three days after the date of giving
the notice required by subsection (7), the tax code speciﬁed in that declaration
or certiﬁcate is deemed to have commenced to apply to the employee
immediately after the former tax code ceased to apply to the employee.
(7) Where a tax code ceases under subsection (6) to apply to an employee by reason
of the employee, being an employee to whom a P or S tax code previously
applied, ceasing to be entitled to the use of that code, the employee must, not
later than 4 days after the date on which the employee became aware that the tax
code ceased to apply , give notice in writing of that fact to the employer or
(where the tax code declaration was delivered to the Collector) to the Collector,
stating the reason why a P or S tax code, as the case may be, ceased to apply and
the date it ceased to apply . No employer or other person making a source
deduction payment is liable for making a reduced deduction according to a tax
code after it has ceased under subsection (6) to apply to the employee but before
the employer has received notice (whether under this subsection or otherwise)
that the P or S tax code has ceased to apply to the employee.
(8) A reduced deduction applying to an employee in respect of the employee’s
employment by any employer does not apply to the employee in respect of the
employee’s employment by any other employer, not being a successor of the
ﬁrst-mentioned employer in the same employment.
(9) The Collector may vary any of the requirements of this section in relation to any
employee or class of employees in such cases and to such extent as the Collector
thinks ﬁt, and in every such case this section applies as so varied.
(10) For the purposes of this Act, a tax code declaration or tax code certiﬁcate which
is delivered to an employer before the beginning of any year but is expressed to
relate to that year is deemed to be delivered on 1 January in that year.

1 week
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, where during any week ending with a
Saturday an employee has engaged in more than 1 employment (whether with
the same employer or with two or more employers), the amount of the total tax
deduction required to be made in respect of all payments of salary or wages
made to the employee for that week or any part thereof is deemed to be the
amount of the tax deduction that would have been required to be made if all
s 149LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 693,804

those payments had been 1 payment made by 1 employer for that week, and
where that total tax deduction is not made in full section 156 applies
accordingly:
Provided that, where the employee left 1 regular full-time employment before
engaging in another regular full-time employment, the employee is not deemed
for the purposes of this section to have been engaged in both those employments
in the 1 week.
151 Increased deductions to cover deﬁciency in deductions from advance
payments
(1) Where the amount of the tax deduction to be made from any salary or wages is
increased, and before the date of the increase an employee has received from an
employer a payment of salary or wages to the whole or a part of which the
increase applies, and the proper tax deduction, taking the increase into account
as far as it applies, has not been made in full at the time of the payment, the
amount of the deﬁciency must be added to the tax deduction required to be made
from the next payment of salary or wages made to the employee in the same
employment, and the amount of the tax deduction so required to be made is
deemed to be increased accordingly .
(2) Where any salary or wages become subject to tax deductions under this Part,
and before the date of their becoming so subject an employee has received from
an employer a payment of salary or wages of which the whole or a part is so
subject, and the proper tax deduction has not been made in full at the time of the
payment, the amount of the deﬁciency must be added to the tax deduction
required to be made from the next payment of salary or wages made to the
employee in the same employment, and the amount of the tax deduction so
required to be made is deemed to be increased accordingly .
152 Amount of tax deductions for pay period current when tax altered

amount of the tax deduction for the time being in force in relation to any
payment of salary or wages is reduced or increased by an amendment made to
the basic tax deductions.
(2) Where this section applies, the amount of the tax deduction to be made from a
payment of salary or wages to an employee for a pay period current on the date
on which an altered tax deduction commences to apply is as follows—

respect of the whole of the payment for the pay period is the amount of
the altered tax deduction:

ascertained—
(i) by calculating, on the basis speciﬁed clause 2 of Schedule 2, parts
of the payment for the pay period that are for the respective

Employee’ s duties where deductions are not made
156 Employee to pay deductions to Collector
Where for any reason a tax deduction is not made or is not made in full at the
time of the making of any source deduction payment or payments, the employee
must—
(a) not later than the 20th day of the month next after the month in which
payment of the source deduction payment or payments was made, furnish
to the Collector a return in the prescribed form of the source deduction
payment or payments; and
(b) unless the employee is exempted from liability to pay the same or is not
liable to pay the same, pay to the Collector an amount equal to the total
of the tax deductions that should have been made and were not made, and

month next after the month in which the source deduction payment or
payments was or were made.
Pay-period taxpayers
157 Interpretation
(1) For the purposes of this Act an employee is, subject to subsection (2), deemed
to be a pay-period taxpayer in respect of any year if in that year:
(a) the employee did not derive any income except—
(i) income from employment not exceeding in the aggregate $10,000;
and
(ii) interest not exceeding in the aggregate $1,000; and
(iii) assessable income from any other source (before any deductions
allowed under this Act) not exceeding $500; and
(b) the employee is not an absentee as deﬁned in section 38.
(2) Despite subsection (1), any employee is deemed not to be a pay-period taxpayer
in respect of any year, if the Collector so decides upon the grounds that
subsection (1) would not have applied to the employee for that year had not the
income of the employee from source deduction payments been diminished by
reason of the occurrence in the year of the employee’s retirement of the
employee from employment or of some other event, including the employee’s
death, disability , or absence from the Cook Islands, causing the termination or
suspension of the employee’s employment, and that—
(a) the employee is not a person to whom subsection (1) would normally
apply; or
(b) it appeared at any time during the year that subsection (1) would not
apply to the employee for the year.
s 157 INCOME T AX ACT 1997
Service 0694,003

158 T ax of pay-period taxpayers to be determined by amount of tax deductions
or by assessment
(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the amount of income tax for which a
pay-period taxpayer is liable in respect of the income derived by the taxpayer in
any year must be determined exclusively and ﬁnally by the total amount of the
tax deductions required under this Part to be made from that income, except
where the taxpayer has not later than the end of the next succeeding year or
within such further period as the Collector may allow in any case or class of
cases, furnished to the Collector a return of that income, in which case the
amount of that income tax is the smaller of the following amounts—
(a) the total amount of those tax deductions:
(b) the amount of the income tax that would be payable in respect of that
income under an assessment made in accordance with Part 5.
(2) Except where a return of income is furnished for the purpose of having the
amount of income tax in respect of the income for the year assessed in
accordance with Part 5 a pay-period taxpayer to whom this section applies shall
not furnish a return of income for the year unless the Collector requires the
taxpayer to do so.
159 Adjustment of excessive tax deductions
In any case where—
(a) the amount of income tax for which a pay-period taxpayer is liable in
respect of the income derived by the taxpayer in any year is determined
exclusively and ﬁnally , pursuant to section 158(1), by the total amount of
the tax deductions required under this Part to be made from that income;
and
(b) the Collector is satisﬁed that the total amount of the tax deductions made
from payments of that income to the taxpayer is in excess of the total
amount of the tax deductions required under this Part to be made from
that income, the Collector must pay to the taxpayer the amount of that
excess or, at the option of the Collector, credit that amount in payment of
any tax due by the taxpayer and unpaid:
Provided that no payment may be made or credit given under this section after
the expiration of the period of 6 years immediately after the end of the year in
which that income was derived, except where written application for the
payment or credit is made by or on behalf of the taxpayer before the expiration
of that period.
Assessment and payment of income tax
160 Assessment and payment of income tax
(1) Subject to section 158, the amount of income tax for which an employee is
liable in respect of the income derived by him or her in any income year must
be assessed under Part 5.
(2) All income tax payable under any assessment made in accordance with
subsection (1) and not previously due and payable is due and payable on 1
October in the year next succeeding the income year, or on such earlier date as
speciﬁed in that behalf in the notice of assessment given to the employee, not
being less than 30 days after the date of the notice.

Crediting tax deductions
161 T ax deductions to be credited against tax assessed
(1) Every employee who is required to furnish or who furnishes to the Collector a
return of any assessable income derived by that employee in any income year
must, except where the Collector otherwise directs, forward to the Collector
with the return all tax deduction certiﬁcates delivered to the employee in respect
of tax deductions made in the income year from source deduction payments
made to the employee.
(2) Where the Collector receives from an employee any tax deduction certiﬁcates in
respect of tax deductions made in the income year from source deduction
payments made to the employee, or receives the amount of any tax deduction so
made and not included in any tax deduction certiﬁcate, and the Collector has
made an assessment of income tax in respect of the income derived by the
employee in the income year or is satisﬁed that no income tax is payable in
respect of that income, the Collector must credit the total of the amounts of the
tax deductions (but not including any additional tax or penal tax) shown in the
certiﬁcates, or received as aforesaid, in payment successively of—
(a) the income tax (if any) payable by the employee in respect of the
employee’s taxable income for the income year:
(b) the income tax (if any) due by the employee and unpaid in respect of any
year before that income year:
(c) the income tax (including provisional tax) (if any) due by the employee
and unpaid in respect of any year after that income year and, if more than
1, in the order of those years:
and must refund to the employee an amount equal to the amount of the tax
deductions not so credited.
(3) If the amount credited by the Collector under subsection (2)(b) is less than the
total of the income tax referred to in that paragraph, the Collector must apply the
amount so credited, so far as the amount extends, in payment of such income tax
as the Collector determines.
(4) If the Collector has reason to believe that any tax deduction certiﬁcate received
by the Collector for the purposes of this section is incorrect in any particular, the
Collector may retain the certiﬁcate for such period as the Collector thinks ﬁt,
and must not deal with the certiﬁcate as required by the foregoing provisions of
this section until the Collector is satisﬁed that the certiﬁcate is correct.
(5) Where the Collector has credited in payment of income tax, or made a refund in
respect of, an amount shown in a tax deduction certiﬁcate which is in excess of
the amount that the employer has deducted from a source deduction payment to
which the certiﬁcate relates, the employer and the employee are jointly and
severally liable to pay to the Collector the amount of the excess, and that
amount is deemed to have become due and payable on 15 February in the year
after the year to the whole or part of which the tax deduction certiﬁcate relates.
162 Lost tax deduction certiﬁcates
Where the Collector is satisﬁed that a tax deduction certiﬁcate has been lost or
destroyed, and is satisﬁed as to the amount of the deductions shown in that
certiﬁcate, the Collector must apply section 161 in the same manner as if the
certiﬁcate had been received by the Collector.
s 162 INCOME T AX ACT 1997
Service 0694,005

163 T ax deductions for which no certiﬁcate issued
Where the Collector is satisﬁed that any employer has made any tax deduction
from a source deduction payment made to an employee, and has failed to deliver
to the employee within the prescribed time a tax deduction certiﬁcate in respect
of the deduction, the Collector must apply section 161 in the same manner as if
a tax deduction certiﬁcate showing the tax deduction had been delivered to the
employee and received by the Collector.

Recovery of tax deductions
164 Recovery of tax deductions from employers
(1) The amount of every tax deduction made under this Part is held in trust for the
Crown; and any amount so held in trust is property of the employer liable to
execution, and, in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of the employer or
of an assignment for the beneﬁt of the employer’s creditors, remains apart, and
forms no part of the estate in bankruptcy , liquidation, or assignment.
(2) Where a tax deduction has been made under this Part and the employer has
failed to deal with the amount of the tax deduction or any part thereof in the
manner required by subsection (1) or the other provisions of this Part, the
amount of the tax deduction for the time being unpaid to the Collector ranks, in
the application of the assets of the employer upon the bankruptcy or liquidation
of the employer or upon an assignment for the beneﬁt of the employer’s
creditors, without limitation in amount and despite anything in any other Act, in
order of priority immediately after preferential claims for wages or other sums
payable to or on account of any employee, and in priority to all other claims.
165 Employer failing to make tax deductions
(1) Where an employer fails to make any tax deduction in accordance with the
employer’s obligations under this Part, the amount in respect of which default
has been made constitutes a debt payable by the employer to the Collector, and
is deemed to have become due and payable to the Collector on the 20th day of
the month next after the month in which payment of the source deduction
payment was made.
(2) The right of the Collector to recover from the employer the amount in respect of
which default has been made is in addition to any right of the Collector to
recover that amount from the employee under this Part; and nothing in this Part
may be construed as preventing the Collector from taking such steps as the
Collector thinks ﬁt to recover that amount from the employer and from the
employee concurrently , or from recovering that amount wholly from the
employer or from the employee or partly from the employer and partly from the
employee.
(3) Where any amount, including a penalty , recoverable in accordance with this Part
from the employee is in fact paid by the employer, the amount so paid may be
recovered by the employer from the employee.
166 Unpaid tax deductions, etc to constitute a charge on employer’s property
(1) Where an employer fails wholly or in part to make any tax deduction in
accordance with the employer’s obligations under this Part, or is liable to pay
any sum to the Collector under this Part, an amount equal to the total for the
time being unpaid to the Collector in respect of that tax deduction or sum
(including any additional tax or penal tax), and in respect of any judgment
obtained therefor (including any costs, fees, or expenses included in the
judgment or otherwise payable by the employer to the Collector in respect
thereof) is a charge on all the real and personal property of the employer.
(2) Every charge created by this section is subject to all mortgages, charges, or
encumbrances existing at the time of the creation of the charge, but, subject to
the provisions of this section, has priority over all other mortgages, charges, or
encumbrances. Despite anything in any other Act, if any property subject to the
s 166 INCOME T AX ACT 1997
Service 0694,201

charge created by this section is also subject to a charge created by that other
Act, the charges rank equally with each other unless by virtue of that other Act
the charge created thereby would be deferred to the charge created by this
section.
(3) The Collector may register any charge on any property created by this section
under any registration Act to which the property is subject by depositing with
the appropriate Registrar a certiﬁcate signed by the Collector stating the
description of the property charged and the amount payable; and in every such
case the Registrar must, without payment of any fee, register the certiﬁcate as if
it were an instrument registrable under the registration Act.
(4) Upon the registration of any such certiﬁcate under any registration Act it is
deemed to be actual notice to all persons of the existence and amount of the
charge, and the charge has operation and priority accordingly in relation to the
property that is subject to the charge and to the registration Act:
Provided that in so far as any mortgage that is registered in respect of that
property before the registration of the charge secures any money that is
advanced after written notice of the charge or of the registration of the charge
has been given to the mortgagee, or to any solicitor for the time being acting for
the mortgagee in respect of the mortgage, the charge has priority over the
mortgage.
(5) When any registered charge has been satisﬁed, the Collector must deposit with
the appropriate Registrar a release of the charge, and the Registrar must, without
payment of any fee, register the release as if it were an instrument registrable
under the registration Act.
(6) Any charge created by this section which is registered against any property
operates to secure any amount secured by any prior unregistered charge and
unpaid at the time of the registration of the charge, and also to secure any
amount secured by any charge coming into existence after the registration of the
charge, to the intent that the registered charge operates to secure the total of all
amounts for the time being owing by the employer under all charges created by
this section.
(7) If any amount constitutes by virtue of this section a charge on any property the
High Court may make such order as it thinks ﬁt, either for the sale of that
property or any part thereof, or for the appointment of a receiver of the rents,
proﬁts, or income thereof, and for the payment of the amount of the charge and
the costs of the Collector out of the proceeds of the sale or out of the rents,
proﬁts, or income.
(8) Where any property has been sold under any such order, the High Court may , on
the application of the purchaser or the Collector, make an order vesting the
property in the purchaser.
(9) Every such vesting order has the same ef fect as if all persons entitled to the
property had been free from all disability and had duly executed all proper
conveyances, transfers, and assignments of the property for such estate or
interest as is speciﬁed in the order.
(10) This section applies subject to section 164.

person commits an of fence against this Act who—
s 166LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS

(a) being an employer or other person by whom a source deduction payment
is made to an employee, fails wholly or in part to make a tax deduction
therefrom in accordance with that person’s obligations under this Part; or
(b) knowingly applies or permits to be applied the amount of any tax
deduction or any part thereof for any purpose other than the payment of
the tax deduction to the Collector; or
(c) makes a false or misleading tax code declaration, or gives any false
information, or misleads or attempts to mislead the Collector or any other

af fecting a tax deduction or a reduced deduction; or
(d) delivers or maintains or attempts to deliver or maintain in contravention
of this Part, a tax code declaration or a tax code certiﬁcate in respect of
more than 1 employment, or otherwise obtains or attempts to obtain, in
contravention of this Part, the beneﬁt of a reduced deduction in respect of
more than 1 employment; or
(e) alters any tax code certiﬁcate issued by the Collector, or falsely pretends
to be the employee named in any such certiﬁcate, or possesses without
lawful justiﬁcation or excuse, a colourable imitation of any such
certiﬁcate, or, in contravention of this Act, causes or attempts to cause
any employer or other person to refrain from making a tax deduction, or
to make a reduced deduction, by the production of any document other
than a tax code certiﬁcate issued by the Collector and for the time being
in force; or
(f) alters any tax deduction certiﬁcate, or falsely pretends to be the employee
named in any such certiﬁcate, or, in contravention of this Act, obtains or
attempts to obtain for the person’s own advantage or beneﬁt credit with
respect to, or a payment of, the whole or any part of the amount of a tax
deduction made from a source deduction payment received by another
person.
(2) Every person who commits an of fence against subsection (1)(b) is liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a ﬁne not exceeding
$10,000 or to both.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a tax deduction is deemed to have been
made if and when payment is made of the net amount of any source deduction
payment, and the amount of the tax deduction is deemed to have been applied
for a purpose other than the payment thereof if the amount of the tax deduction
is not duly paid to the Collector:
Provided that no person may be convicted of an of fence under subsection (1)(b)
if that person satisﬁes the court that the amount of the tax deduction has been
accounted for, and that failure to account for it within the prescribed time was
due to illness, accident, or other cause beyond the control of that person.
168 Penal tax for default in making or paying tax deduction
(1) Where—
(a) any employer or other person by whom any source deduction payment is
made fails wholly or in part to make a tax deduction therefrom in
accordance with that person’s obligations under this Part; or
(b) any person knowingly applies or permits to be applied the amount of any
tax deduction or any part thereof for any purpose other than the payment
of the tax deduction to the Collector:
s 168 INCOME T AX ACT 1997
Service 0694,203

that employer or other person is chargeable by way of penalty , in addition to any
other penalty to which that person may be liable, with an additional amount
(penal tax ) not exceeding an amount equal to treble the amount in respect of
which default has been made (the deﬁcient deduction ).
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a tax deduction is deemed to have been
made if and when payment is made of the net amount of any source deduction
payment, and the amount of the tax deduction is deemed to have been applied
for a purpose other than the payment thereof if the amount of the tax deduction
is not duly paid to the Collector:
Provided that no person is chargeable with penal tax under subsection (1)(b) if
that person satisﬁes the Collector that the amount of the tax deduction has been
accounted for, and that failure to account for it within the prescribed time was
due to illness, accident, or other cause beyond the control of that person.
(3) Penal tax imposed by this section is for all purposes deemed to be of the same
nature as the deﬁcient deduction, and is recoverable accordingly .
(4) Subject to the provisions of this Part, the provisions of the other Parts, as far as
they are applicable and with the necessary modiﬁcations, apply with respect to
all penal tax imposed under this section as if—
(a) it were penal tax under section 209; and
(b) the person chargeable with the penal tax imposed under this section were
the taxpayer; and
(c) the deﬁcient deduction were deﬁcient tax payable for the same year of
assessment as that in which the deﬁcient deduction became due and
payable to the Collector.
169 Additional tax for default in making tax deduction or in paying any amount
due to Collector
(1) Where—
(a) any employer or other person by whom any source deduction payment is
made fails wholly or in part to make a tax deduction therefrom in
accordance with obligations under this Part; or
(b) any person who has made a tax deduction fails wholly or in part within
the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner to pay the amount of the
tax deduction to the Collector; or

178 T axpayer to estimate amount of provisional tax subject to adjustment by
Collector
(1) The amount of provisional tax payable by a taxpayer in respect of the income or
an income year must, subject to adjustment by the Collector, be ascertained in
the ﬁrst instance by the taxpayer to such extent and in such manner as may be
prescribed in the annual return that the taxpayer is required to furnish in that
year of the income of the preceding year, or as may be prescribed by the
Collector in such other manner as the Collector thinks ﬁt.
(2) If any provisional taxpayer makes default in furnishing the annual return that the
taxpayer is required to furnish in an income year of the income of the preceding
year, or if the Collector is not satisﬁed with the return made by any provisional
taxpayer, or if the Collector has reason to suppose that any person, although that
person has not made a return, is a provisional taxpayer, the Collector may
estimate the amount that ought to be the amount of the provisional tax for the
income year and, save in so far as the taxpayer establishes by reason of the
amendment of any assessment of income tax that the provisional tax as
s 175LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 694,402

ascertained is excessive or that the taxpayer is not chargeable with the
provisional tax, the provisional tax so ascertained is the provisional tax payable
by the taxpayer in respect of the income of the income year, and the taxpayer is
liable, or is deemed to have been liable, to pay the provisional tax as ascertained
in the manner and at the time or times (whether before or after the provisional
tax is so ascertained) speciﬁed in a notice given to the taxpayer by the Collector
under subsection (3) having regard to the manner and time or times of payment
and the amounts of the instalments (if any) that would be applicable if the
taxpayer had furnished an annual return within the time ﬁxed therefor under
section 15 or, as the case may be, if the Collector had been satisﬁed with the
return furnished by the taxpayer.
(3) After the Collector has ascertained the amount of the provisional tax the
Collector may , where the Collector considers it necessary or advisable to do so,
give notice to the taxpayer of the amount of the provisional tax and of the
amount of any instalment thereafter to be paid, but the omission to give any
such notice does not relieve the taxpayer from liability to pay on the due date
thereof any instalment of the provisional tax required to be ascertained by the
taxpayer under subsection (1).
(4) The ascertainment of the amount of any provisional tax by the Collector is not
open to objection by the taxpayer under Part 4.

the income derived by the taxpayer in the preceding year:
(b) the second instalment is due and payable on the date 6 months after the
date on which that ﬁrst instalment of provisional tax is due and payable.
(2) In any case where the Collector gives a notice to any taxpayer under
section 178(3), the amount of any instalment of provisional tax that is payable
after the Collector has given such notice is the amount speciﬁed in that behalf
in the notice.
180 Interim returns
(1) Subclause (2) applies in every case where a provisional taxpayer is liable in an
income year to furnish a return of the income derived by that taxpayer in the
preceding year (the required return) and to pay instalments of provisional tax
in respect of the income of the income year, and pursuant to an extension of time
granted under section 15(3) for furnishing the required return, the taxpayer is
not required to furnish, and does not furnish, the required return by the due date
for payment of the ﬁrst instalment of the provisional tax.
(2) The taxpayer, not later than the due date for payment of the ﬁrst instalment of
the provisional tax in respect of income derived in the income year, or within
such further period as the Collector may allow in any case or class of cases,
must furnish a return marked “interim” in the prescribed form showing the
estimated assessable income of the taxpayer for the preceding year and the
taxpayer’s calculation of the amount of the provisional tax which the taxpayer
would be liable to pay in respect of the taxpayer’s income for that income year
s 180 INCOME T AX ACT 1997
Service 0694,403

if that estimated amount of assessable income had been the actual assessable
income of the taxpayer for that preceding year and until the required return is
furnished that amount of provisional tax so calculated is deemed to be the
provisional tax payable by the taxpayer for that income year.
181 Estimated assessable income
(1) Where any taxpayer believes that the income derived by that taxpayer
(otherwise than from source deduction payments) in the income year will be less
than the income so derived by the taxpayer in the preceding year, the taxpayer
may , before the expiration of 1 month after the due date for payment of any
instalment of provisional tax, make an estimate of the amount of the taxpayer’s
assessable income for the income year and furnish to the Collector a statement
showing the amount so estimated and the amount of the provisional tax payable
in accordance with subsection (2):
Provided that the taxpayer may , at any time before the expiration of 1 month
after the due date for payment of the ﬁnal instalment of provisional tax, make 1
or more revised estimates of those amounts, and furnish to the Collector an
amended statement or, as the case may be, amended statements accordingly .
(2) Subject to subsection (3), where a taxpayer duly furnishes to the Collector, in
accordance with subsection (1), a statement or, as the case may be, an amended
or a further amended statement, the amount of assessable income estimated or,
as the case may be, last re-estimated by the taxpayer under that subsection, is,
for the purposes of calculating the amount of provisional tax payable in respect
of the income derived in the income year, deemed to be the assessable income
derived by that taxpayer in the preceding year, and the amount of provisional tax
payable for that income year must be ascertained accordingly .
(3) Subject to the right of the taxpayer to re-estimate in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, where the Collector has reason to believe that the amount
of any kind of income that will be or has been derived by the taxpayer in the
income year is greater than the amount of that kind of income estimated by the
taxpayer, the Collector (whose decision is ﬁnal and conclusive)—
(a) may estimate the respective amounts that, in the opinion of the Collector,
should have been the amounts estimated by the taxpayer under
subsection (1) and shown in the statement furnished under that
subsection; and
(b) may calculate the amount of the provisional tax that would have been
payable if the amounts so estimated by the Collector had been shown in
the statement,
and the amount so calculated is the amount of provisional tax payable by the
taxpayer in respect of the income of the income year.
(4) The respective amounts of income as estimated by the Collector under
subsection (3) must not be greater than the corresponding amounts derived by
the taxpayer in the year preceding the income year.

1. Residence Address . If the Reporting Financial Institution has in its records a
current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on Documentary
Evidence, the Reporting Financial Institution may treat the individual Account
Holder as being a resident for tax purposes of the jurisdiction in which the address
is located for purposes of determining whether such individual Account Holder is a
Reportable Person.
2. Electronic Record Search . If the Reporting Financial Institution does not rely on
a current residence address for the individual Account Holder based on
Documentary Evidence as set forth in subparagraph B(1), the Reporting Financial
Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting
Financial Institution for any of the following indicia and apply subparagraphs B(3)
through (6);
a) identiﬁcation of the Account Holder as a resident of a Reportable Jurisdiction;
b) current mailing or residence address (including a post of f ice box) in a

e) currently ef fective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person
with an address in a Reportable Jurisdiction; or
f) a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address in a Reportable Jurisdiction
if the Reporting Financial Institution does not have any other address on ﬁle
for the Account Holder.
3. If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the electronic
search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances
that results in one or more indicia being associated with the account, or the account
becomes a High V alue Account.
4. If any of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are discovered in the
electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more
indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution
must treat the Account Holder as a resident for tax purposes of each Reportable
Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identiﬁed, unless it elects to apply
subparagraph B(6) and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with
respect to that account.
5. If a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address is discovered in the electronic
search and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in
subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are identiﬁed for the Account Holder, the
Reporting Financial Institution must, in the order most appropriate to the
circumstances, apply the paper record search described in subparagraph C(2), or
seek to obtain from the Account Holder a self-certiﬁcation or Documentary
Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of such Account Holder. If
the paper search fails to establish an indicium and the attempt to obtain the
self-certiﬁcation or Documentary Evidence is not successful, the Reporting
Financial Institution must report the account as an undocumented account.
6. Notwithstanding a ﬁnding of indicia under subparagraph B(2), a Reporting
Financial Institution is not required to treat an Account Holder as a resident of a
Reportable Jurisdiction if:

previously reviewed and maintains a record of:
i) a self-certiﬁcation from the Account Holder of the jurisdiction(s) of
residence of such Account Holder that does not include such Reportable
Jurisdiction; or
ii) Documentary Evidence establishing the Account Holder’s
non-reportable status.
C. Enhanced Review Procedures for High V alue Accounts. The following enhanced
review procedures apply with respect to High V alue Accounts.
1. Electronic Record Search. With respect to High V alue Accounts, the Reporting
Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the

in subparagraph B(2).
2. Paper Record Search. If the Reporting Financial Institution’s electronically
searchable databases include ﬁelds for, and capture all of the information described
in, subparagraph C(3), then a further paper record search is not required. If the
electronic databases do not capture all of this information, then with respect to a
High V alue Account, the Reporting Financial Institution must also review the
current customer master ﬁle and, to the extent not contained in the current customer
master ﬁle, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by
the Reporting Financial Institution within the last 5 years for any of the indicia

SchLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 705,804

c) the Account Holder’s telephone number(s) currently on ﬁle, if any , with the
Reporting Financial Institution;
d) in the case of Financial Accounts other than Depository Accounts, whether
there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another

e) whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” instruction for
the Account Holder; and
f) whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account.

electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting Financial
Institution must treat as a Reportable Account any High V alue Account assigned to
a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with that High
V alue Account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account
Holder is a Reportable Person.
5. Ef fect of Finding Indicia
a) If none of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2) are discovered in the
enhanced review of High V alue Accounts described above, and the account is
not identiﬁed as held by a Reportable Person in subparagraph C(4), then
further action is not required until there is a change in circumstances that
results in one or more indicia being associated with the account.
b) If any of the indicia listed in subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are discovered
in the enhanced review of High V alue Accounts described above, or if there is
a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more indicia being
associated with the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat
the account as a Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable
Jurisdiction for which an indicium is identiﬁed unless it elects to apply
subparagraph B(6) of this section and one of the exceptions in such
subparagraph applies with respect to that account.
c) If a “hold mail” instruction or “in-care-of” address is discovered in the
electronic search and no other address and none of the other indicia listed in
subparagraph B(2)(a) through (e) are identiﬁed for the Account Holder, the
Reporting Financial Institution must obtain from such Account Holder a
self-certiﬁcation or Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax
purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot
obtain such self-certiﬁcation or Documentary Evidence, it must report the
account as an undocumented account.
6. If a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High V alue Account as of [31 December
2016], but becomes a High V alue Account as of the last day of a subsequent
calendar year, the Reporting Financial Institution must complete the enhanced
review procedures described in paragraph C with respect to such account within the
calendar year following the year in which the account becomes a High V alue
Account. If based on this review such account is identiﬁed as a Reportable Account,
the Reporting Financial Institution must report the required information about such
account with respect to the year in which it is identiﬁed as a Reportable Account and
subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a
Reportable Person. [ Note: see section 96C(1) of the Act.]
Sch INCOME T AX (AEF AI) REGULA TIONS 2017
Service 0705,805

7. Once a Reporting Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures
described in paragraph C to a High V alue Account, the Reporting Financial
Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship
manager inquiry described in subparagraph C(4), to the same High V alue Account
in any subsequent year unless the account is undocumented where the Reporting
Financial Institution should re-apply them annually until such account ceases to be
undocumented.
8. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High V alue Account that
results in one or more indicia described in subparagraph B(2) being associated with
the account, then the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a
Reportable Account with respect to each Reportable Jurisdiction for which an
indicium is identiﬁed unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(6) and one of the
exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.
9. A Reporting Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a
relationship manager identiﬁes any change in circumstances of an account. For
example, if a relationship manager is notiﬁed that the Account Holder has a new
mailing address in a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution is
required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to
apply subparagraph B(6), is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from
the Account Holder.
D. Review of Preexisting Individual Accounts must be completed by [31 December 2017 if
a High V alue Account or 31 December 2018 of a Low V olume Account]. ( Note: see
section 96C(1) of the Act.]
E. Any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identiﬁed as a Reportable Account
under this section must be treated as a Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless
the Account Holder ceases to be a Reportable Person.
Section IV : Due Diligence for New Individual Accounts
The following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among New
Individual Accounts.
A. With respect to New Individual Accounts, upon account opening, the Reporting Financial
Institution must obtain a self-certiﬁcation, which may be part of the account opening
documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine the Account
Holder’s residence(s) for tax purposes and conﬁrm the reasonableness of such
self-certiﬁcation based on the information obtained by the Reporting Financial Institution
in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected
pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures.
B. If the self-certiﬁcation establishes that the Account Holder is resident for tax purposes in
a Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a
Reportable Account and the self-certiﬁcation must also include the Account Holder’s TIN
with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction (subject to paragraph D of Section I) and date
of birth.
C. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes
the Reporting Financial Institution to know , or have reason to know , that the original
self-certiﬁcation is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution cannot rely
on the original self-certiﬁcation and must obtain a valid self-certiﬁcation that establishes
the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder.
Section V : Due Diligence for Preexisting Entity Accounts
The following procedures apply for purposes of identifying Reportable Accounts among
Preexisting Entity Accounts.
SchLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 705,806

D. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which
Reporting Is Required. For Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B, a
Reporting Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine
whether the account is held by one or more Reportable Persons, or by Passive NFEs with
one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons:
1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Reportable Person.
a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship
purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures)
to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is
resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction. For this purpose, information indicating
that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable Jurisdiction includes a
place of incorporation or organisation, or an address in a Reportable
Jurisdiction.
b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a Reportable
Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the account as a
Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certiﬁcation from the Account
Holder, or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or
that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Reportable Person.
2. Determine Whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with One or More Controlling
Persons Who Are Reportable Persons. With respect to an Account Holder of a
Preexisting Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the
Reporting Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is a
Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. If
any of the Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the
account must be treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations
the Reporting Financial Institution must follow the guidance in
subparagraphs D(2)(a) through (c) in the order most appropriate under the
circumstances.
Sch INCOME T AX (AEF AI) REGULA TIONS 2017
Service 0705,807

a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes
of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting
Financial Institution must obtain a self-certiﬁcation from the Account Holder
to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is
publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the
Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an
Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is
not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution.
b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder . For the
purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a
Reporting Financial Institution may rely on information collected and
maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures.
c) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a
Reportable Person. For the purposes of determining whether a Controlling
Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial
Institution may rely on:
i) information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC
Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or
more NFEs with an aggregate account balance or value that does not
exceed USD 1 000 000; or
ii) a self-certiﬁcation from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person

the calendar year following the year in which the aggregate account balance or
value exceeds USD 250 000. [ Note: see section 96C(1) of the Act.]
3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account
that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know , or have reason to know , that
the self-certiﬁcation or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect
or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must re-determine the status of the
account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D.

1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Reportable Person.
SchLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 705,808

a) Obtain a self-certiﬁcation, which may be part of the account opening
documentation, that allows the Reporting Financial Institution to determine
the Account Holder’s residence(s) for tax purposes and conﬁrm the
reasonableness of such self-certiﬁcation based on the information obtained by
the Reporting Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the
account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC
Procedures. If the Entity certiﬁes that it has no residence for tax purposes, the
Reporting Financial Institution may rely on the address of the principal of f ice
of the Entity to determine the residence of the Account Holder.
b) If the self-certiﬁcation indicates that the Account Holder is resident in a
Reportable Jurisdiction, the Reporting Financial Institution must treat the
account as a Reportable Account unless it reasonably determines based on
information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account
Holder is not a Reportable Person with respect to such Reportable Jurisdiction.
2. Determine Whether the Entity is a Passive NFE with One or More Controlling
Persons Who Are Reportable Persons. With respect to an Account Holder of a
New Entity Account (including an Entity that is a Reportable Person), the Reporting
Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE
with one or more Controlling Persons who are Reportable Persons. If any of the
Controlling Persons of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, then the account must
be treated as a Reportable Account. In making these determinations the Reporting
Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs A(2)(a) through (c)
in the order most appropriate under the circumstances.
a) Determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE. For purposes
of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFE, the Reporting
Financial Institution must rely on a self-certiﬁcation from the Account Holder
to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is
publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the
Account Holder is an Active NFE or a Financial Institution other than an
Investment Entity described in subparagraph A(6)(b) of Section VIII that is
not a Participating Jurisdiction Financial Institution.
b) Determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder . For purposes
of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting
Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained
pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures.
c) Determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a
Reportable Person. For purposes of determining whether a Controlling
Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial
Institution may rely on a self-certiﬁcation from the Account Holder or such
Controlling Person.
Section VII: Special Due Diligence Rules
The following additional rules apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described
above:
A. Reliance on Self-Certiﬁcations and Documentary Evidence. A Reporting Financial
Institution may not rely on a self-certiﬁcation or Documentary Evidence if the Reporting
Financial Institution knows or has reason to know that the self-certiﬁcation or
Documentary Evidence is incorrect or unreliable.
Sch INCOME T AX (AEF AI) REGULA TIONS 2017
Service 0705,809

B. Alternative Procedures for Financial Accounts Held by Individual Beneﬁciaries of a
Cash V alue Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract. A Reporting Financial
Institution may presume that an individual beneﬁciary (other than the owner) of a Cash
V alue Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract receiving a death beneﬁt is not a
Reportable Person and may treat such Financial Account as other than a Reportable
Account unless the Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to
know , that the beneﬁciary is a Reportable Person. A Reporting Financial Institution has
reason to know that a beneﬁciary of a Cash V alue Insurance Contract or an Annuity
Contract is a Reportable Person if the information collected by the Reporting Financial
Institution and associated with the beneﬁciary contains indicia as described in paragraph B
of Section III. If a Reporting Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to
know , that the beneﬁciary is a Reportable Person, the Reporting Financial Institution must
follow the procedures in paragraph B of Section III.
C. Account Balance Aggregation and Currency Rules
1. Aggregation of Individual Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate
balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting Financial
Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts maintained by the
Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity , but only to the extent that the
Reporting Financial Institution’s computerised systems link the Financial Accounts
by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow account
balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account
is attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for
purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this subparagraph.
2. Aggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate
balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity , a Reporting Financial
Institution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are maintained
by the Reporting Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity , but only to the extent
that the Reporting Financial Institution’s computerized systems link the Financial
Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or TIN, and allow
account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial
Account is attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial
Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this
subparagraph.
3. Special Aggregation Rule Applicable to Relationship Managers. For purposes of
determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a person
to determine whether a Financial Account is a High V alue Account, a Reporting
Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial Accounts that a
relationship manager knows, or has reason to know , are directly or indirectly owned,
controlled, or established (other than in a ﬁduciary capacity) by the same person, to
aggregate all such accounts.
4. Amounts Read to Include Equivalent in Other Currencies. All dollar amounts
are in US dollars and shall be read to include equivalent amounts in other
