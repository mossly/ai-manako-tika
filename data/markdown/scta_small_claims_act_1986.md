Part 2
Jurisdiction, functions, and orders of T ribunals
9 Jurisdiction of T ribunals
(1) Subject to this section and section 10, a Tribunal has jurisdiction in respect of,—
(a) a claim founded on contract or quasi-contract; and
(b) a claim for a declaration that a person is not liable to another person in
respect of a claim or demand, founded on contract or quasi-contract,
made with him or her by that person; and
(c) a claim in tort for damage to property resulting from negligence in the
use, care, or control of a motor vehicle.
(2) A Tribunal has such other jurisdiction as is conferred upon it by any other
enactment.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), a claim is within the jurisdiction of a
Tribunal only if the total amount in respect of which an order of the Tribunal is
sought does not exceed $500 including,—
(a) where a claim is made for the recovery of chattels, the value of those
chattels; and
(b) where a claim is made for a work order, the value of the work sought to
be included therein.
(4) If it is necessary for the purposes of this Act to ascertain the value of any
chattels or work or to resolve any dispute as to such value (whether for the
purposes of subsection (3) or otherwise), that value must be determined by the
Tribunal in such manner as it thinks ﬁt, and the Tribunal may for that purpose
appoint an Investigator to report to it under section 27.
(5) Subject to this Act and the Limitation Act 1950 of the Parliament of New
Zealand, as applied to the Cook Islands, the jurisdiction of a Tribunal extends to
a claim based on a cause of action which accrued before the commencement of
this Act.
10 Further limitation of jurisdiction
(1) A debt or liquidated demand may be the subject of a declaration under
section 9(1)(b), but, subject to subsection (2), a claim for a debt or liquidated
demand is not within the jurisdiction conferred by section 9(1)(a), unless,—
(a) the claimant satisﬁes the Registrar, before the claim is lodged in a
Tribunal, that the claim, or a part thereof, is in dispute; or
(b) the claimant either,—
(i) satisﬁes the Registrar before the claim is lodged in a Tribunal; or
(ii) not having lodged or attempted to lodge the claim pursuant to
subparagraph (i), satisﬁes the Tribunal at a hearing,
that the claim is in the nature of counterclaim by a respondent against a
claimant; or
(c) the claim is transferred to a Tribunal pursuant to section 23.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a Tribunal may—
(a) where a respondent raises a debt or liquidated demand as a defence by
way of set-of f, give ef fect to that defence:
Service 0111,001

(b) where it dismisses a claim for a declaration under section 9(1)(b) in
respect of a debt or liquidated demand, make an order under
section 16(1)(a) requiring the claimant to pay the debt or liquidated
demand, or part thereof, to the respondent.
(3) Except as provided in an enactment referred to in section 9(2), a Tribunal has no
jurisdiction in respect of any claim,—
(a) for the recovery of land or any estate or interest therein:
(b) in which the title to any land, or any estate or interest therein, or to any
franchise in question:
(c) in which there is a dispute concerning the entitlement of any person under
a will, or any settlement, or on intestacy (including a partial intestacy).
(4) Without limiting section 9(2), nothing in subsection (1) of that section, in so far
as it confers jurisdiction in quasi-contract on a Tribunal, is to be construed as
authorising a claim in respect of money due under any enactment.
(5) In subsection (4) enactment means a provision of any Act or of any other
instrument which has legislative ef fect and which is authorised by or pursuant to
any Act.
(6) A Tribunal may hear and determine a claim in the nature of a counterclaim to
which subsection (1)(b) applies, notwithstanding that the original claim is
withdrawn, abandoned, or struck out.
11 Abandonment to bring within jurisdiction
A person may abandon so much of a claim as exceeds $500 in order to bring the
claim within the jurisdiction of a Tribunal; and in that event an order of the
Tribunal under this Act or any other enactment, in relation to the claim, operates
to discharge from liability in respect of the amount so abandoned any person
against whom the claim and the subsequent order is made.
12 Cause of action not to be divided
A cause of action shall not be divided into 2 or more claims for the purpose of
bringing it within the jurisdiction of a Tribunal.
13 Contracting out prohibited
(1) A provision in any agreement (including one made before the commencement of
this Act) to exclude or limit,—
(a) the jurisdiction of a Tribunal; or
(b) the right of any person to invoke that jurisdiction shall be of no ef fect.
(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a Tribunal has jurisdiction in
respect of a claim notwithstanding any agreement relating thereto which
provides for—
(a) the submission to arbitration of any dispute or dif ference; or
(b) the making of an award upon such a submission to be a condition
precedent to any cause of action accruing to a party to the agreement.
(3) Subsection (1) does not apply where a cause of action has accrued, or is
believed to have accrued, to a person and he or she has agreed to the settlement
or compromise of the claim based on that cause of action.
14 Exclusion of other jurisdictions
(1) Where a claim is lodged with or transferred to a Tribunal and is within its
jurisdiction, the issues in dispute in that claim (whether as shown in the initial
s 10LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 111,002

proceedings between the same parties in the High Court unless—
(a) an order is made under section 22(2) or section 36(1)(b); or
(b) the proceedings before the High Court were commenced before the claim
was lodged with or transferred to the Tribunal; or
(c) the claim before the Tribunal is withdrawn, abandoned, or struck out.
(2) Where subsection (1)(b) applies to proceedings before the High Court, the
issues in dispute in the claim to which those proceedings relate (whether shown
in the initial claim or emerging in the course of the hearing) may not be the
subject of proceedings between the same parties in a Tribunal, unless the
proceedings are transferred to a Tribunal under section 23 or the claim before
the High Court is withdrawn, abandoned, or struck out.
15 Functions of T ribunal
(1) The primary function of a Tribunal is to attempt to bring the parties to a dispute
to an agreed settlement.
(2) Where an agreed settlement is reached, the Tribunal may make one or more of
the orders which it is empowered to make under section 16 or under any other
enactment, but is not bound by the monetary restrictions provided for by
subsections (3) and (4) of section 16.
(3) If it appears to the Tribunal to be impossible to reach a settlement under
subsection (1) within a reasonable time, the Tribunal must proceed to determine
the dispute.
(4) The Tribunal must determine the dispute according to the substantial merits and
justice of the case, and in doing so must have regard to the law but is not bound
to give ef fect to strict legal rights or obligations or to legal forms or
technicalities.
(5) Without limiting the generality of subsection (4), a Tribunal may , in respect of
any agreement or document which directly or indirectly bears upon the dispute
between the parties, disregard any provision therein which excludes or limits—
(a) conditions, warranties, or undertakings; or
(b) any right, duty , liability , or remedy which would arise or accrue in the
circumstances of the dispute if there were no such exclusion or limitation.
(6) T o give ef fect to its determination of the dispute under subsection (3), or in
granting relief in respect of any claim which is not disputed (except where
subsection (2) applies), the Tribunal must make one or more of the orders which
it is empowered to make under section 16 or under any other enactment.
16 Orders of T ribunal
(1) A Tribunal may , as regards any claim within its jurisdiction, make one or more
of the following orders and may include therein such stipulations and conditions
(whether as to the time for, or mode of, compliance or otherwise) as it thinks
ﬁt,—
(a) the Tribunal may order a party to the proceedings to pay money to any
other party:
(b) the Tribunal may make an order declaring that a person is not liable to
another in respect of a claim or demand described in section 9(1)(b):

s 16 SMALL CLAIMS ACT 1986
Service 0111,003

(d) the Tribunal may make a work order against any party to the proceedings:
(e) where it appears to the Tribunal that an agreement between the parties, or
any term thereof, is harsh or unconscionable, or that any power conferred
by an agreement between them has been exercised in a harsh or
unconscionable manner, the Tribunal may make an order varying the
agreement, or setting it aside (either wholly or in part):
(f) where it appears to the Tribunal that an agreement between the parties has
been induced by fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake, or any writing
purporting to express the agreement between the parties does not accord
with their true agreement, the Tribunal may make an order varying, or
setting aside, the agreement or the writing (either wholly or in part):
(g) the Tribunal may make an order dismissing the claim.
(2) Where a Tribunal makes a work order against a party , it—
(a) must, where the order is made under section 15(6) or section 32(2); and
(b) may , where the order is made under section 15(2),
at the same time make an order under subsection (1)(a) to be complied with as
an alternative to compliance with the work order.
(3) A Tribunal must not make an order under this Act which exceeds the monetary
restriction hereunder which is applicable to that order and any order which does
exceed that restriction is entirely of no ef fect. The monetary restrictions are—
(a) an order under subsection (1)(a) must not require payment of money
exceeding $500:
(b) a declaration under subsection (1)(b) must not relate to a claim or demand
exceeding $500:

$500 in value:

not exceed $500 in value:

agreement if the value of the consideration for the promise or act of any
party to the agreement exceeds $500.
(4) Nothing in subsections (1) or (3) restricts the making by a Tribunal of any order
which it is authorised to make by any other enactment.
17 Orders of T ribunal to be ﬁnal

Registrar to give, and the Registrar must give, to such person notice of the
claim, and of the time and place of hearing.
(3) For the purposes of this section, a person has a suf f icient connection with the

questions in dispute in the claim or to grant the relief which it considers to be
due.
(4) Where a claim to which section 10(1)(b)(ii) applies is made at a hearing, the
Tribunal may , in relation to that claim, dispense with the requirements of this

so and who is not disqualiﬁed by section 24(5), and authorise that person
to control the conduct of the minor’s case; or

thereafter, authorise that representative to control the conduct of the

opinion of the Tribunal would more properly be determined in the High Court,
the Tribunal may , on the application of a party or of its own motion, order that
the proceedings be transferred to the High Court.
23 T ransfer of proceedings from High Court
(1) This subsection applies where proceedings within the jurisdiction of a Tribunal
have been commenced in the High Court before a claim in respect of the same
issues between the same parties has been lodged in, or transferred to, a
Tribunal,—
(a) if the defendant, within the number of days speciﬁed by rules made under
the Judicature Act 1980–81, ﬁles a notice of intention to defend the claim
and requests in that notice that the proceedings be transferred to the
Tribunal, the Registrar must transfer the proceedings accordingly:
(b) in every other case the Registrar may , on the application of either party or
of his or her own motion, order that the proceedings be transferred to the
Tribunal, subject to such provision (if any) as to payment of costs as he
or she thinks ﬁt.
(2) A Tribunal to which proceedings are transferred under subsection (1) may have
regard to any notes of evidence transmitted to it and it is not necessary for that
evidence to be given again in the Tribunal unless the Tribunal so requires.

representative under section 24(2) or (3), a person who is, or has been, enrolled
as a barrister or solicitor or who, in the opinion of the Tribunal is, or has been,

a person or one of the persons jointly liable or entitled with another or others.
25 Proceedings to be held in private
(1) All proceedings before a Tribunal must be held in private.
(2) Nothing in subsection (1) prevents a Tribunal from hearing 2 or more claims

proceedings a person who has a genuine and proper interest either in those
proceedings or in the proceedings of Tribunals generally .
26 Evidence

make such other investigations and inquiries as it thinks ﬁt. All evidence and

undisputed claim may be granted by it, on such evidence or information as is
before it, including evidence or information obtained pursuant to section 26(2).
(2) An order made by the Tribunal in the circumstances described in subsection (1)
must not be challenged on the ground that the case of the party was not
presented to the Tribunal, but the party may apply for a rehearing under
section 33 on the ground that there was suf f icient reason for the party’s failure
to present their case.
29 No costs allowable
Costs must not be awarded against a party unless, in the opinion of the Tribunal,

doing, a notice of objection in the prescribed form, the order may , after the

it.

the Tribunal to be heard and determined under section 32(2).

for the enforcement of that order, but the Tribunal may at any time, on the
Service 0113,001

application of a party to the proceedings order that any process may be resumed
or commenced or, the process having been resumed or commenced, order that

hearing; or
