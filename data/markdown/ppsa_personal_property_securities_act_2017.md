Part 2
Security interests
Subpart 1 —Key concepts
6 What this Act is about
This Act mainly relates to—
(a) the enforceability of an interest (a security interest) in personal property
created or provided for by a transaction that secures payment of money or
performance of an obligation:
(b) how to determine priority between security interests in the same personal
property:
(c) how to determine priority between a security interest and another type of
interest (for example, the interest of a buyer of goods) in the same
personal property .
7 What is security interest
(1) In outline, a security interest is the interest of a person (the secured party ) in
the personal property of another person (the debtor) that is created or provided
for by a transaction securing payment of money or performance of an
obligation.
(2) Security interest is fully deﬁned in clause 2 of Schedule 1.
(3) The personal property that is subject to a security interest is called collateral.
Subpart 2 —Security agreement
8 Form and ef fect of security agreement
(1) A security agreement—
(a) must be in written form or in an electronic form that can be printed; and
(b) must be signed by the debtor for a security interest to attach; and
(c) may consist of 1 or more writings or electronic records that, taken
together, establish the intent of the parties.
(2) A security agreement may provide for future advances.
(3) A security agreement may provide for a security interest in after-acquired
property , that is, property that the debtor acquires after the security agreement
has been made.
(4) A security agreement is ef fective between the parties and against third parties
such as purchasers and other creditors, except as provided by this Act.
9 Accelerated payment or performance by debtor
(1) A security agreement may provide that the secured party may accelerate
payment or performance by the debtor when—
(a) the debtor is in default; or
(b) the collateral is at risk; or
(c) payment or other performance by the debtor is at risk.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1),—
Service 035,501

(a) the collateral is at risk if the secured party has commercially reasonable
grounds to believe that the collateral has been or will be destroyed,
damaged, endangered, disassembled, removed, or concealed contrary to
the security agreement:
(b) payment or other performance by the debtor is at risk if the secured party
has commercially reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor is or will
be unable to pay or otherwise perform the debtor’s obligations under the
security agreement.
(3) The secured party has the onus of proving the existence of the grounds listed in
subsection (1).
Subpart 3 —Security interest
10 Obligations
A security interest may secure 1 or more of the following types of obligations—
(a) an obligation that is described speciﬁcally or generally:
(b) a monetary or non-monetary obligation:
(c) a pre-existing, present, or future obligation:
(d) a line of credit.
11 Security interest in consumer goods
A security interest may not be taken in the consumer goods of a debtor except
for a purchase money security interest in those goods.
12 Description of collateral
(1) For the purposes of attachment of a security interest, a description of collateral
is suf f icient if it—
(a) describes the collateral by item or kind in a manner that enables the
collateral to be identiﬁed; or
(b) consists of a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the
debtor’s present and after-acquired property; or
(c) consists of a statement that a security interest is taken in all of the
debtor’s present and after-acquired property except for speciﬁed items or
kinds of property .
(2) In the case of consumer goods, to be suf f icient the description must describe the
goods speciﬁcally .
13 Continuity of security interest
A security interest continues in collateral despite the sale, lease, licence,
exchange or other disposal of the collateral, unless otherwise agreed or provided
by this Act.
Security interest: attachment
14 Attachment of security interest to collateral
(1) A security interest attaches to collateral and is enforceable when—
(a) the secured party has given value; and
(b) the debtor has rights in the collateral; and
(c) 1 of the following conditions is met—
(i) the debtor has entered into and signed a security agreement that
suf f iciently describes the collateral:
s 9LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 35,502

(ii) the secured party has possession of the collateral and a security
interest in that type of collateral may be perfected by possession:
(iii) the secured party has control of the collateral and a security
interest in that type of collateral may be perfected by control.
(2) However, the security agreement may specify a later time for attachment of the
security interest, in which case the security interest attaches at that later time.
(3) T o avoid doubt, a reference in a security agreement to a ﬂoating charge is not an
agreement that the security interest created by the ﬂoating charge attaches at a
later time than the time determined by subsection (1).
(4) Unless otherwise agreed or provided by this Act, a security interest
automatically attaches to proceeds.
(5) Notice to the account debtor is not required for the attachment or perfection of
a security interest in present or future accounts receivable, a secured sales
contract, or a payment intangible.
15 Attachment: when debtor has rights in collateral
(1) In the case of collateral being goods leased, goods consigned, or goods
conditionally sold to the debtor, the debtor has rights in the collateral on
obtaining possession of the goods, if not before.
(2) In subsection (1), goods conditionally sold includes goods sold under an
agreement that provides for the retention of title by the seller.
Subpart 4 —Perfection of security interest
16 Perfection and priority
(1) The priority of enforceable security interests in the same collateral depends
upon—

(b) if more than 1 is perfected, the order in which the security interests were
perfected:
(c) if none is perfected, the order in which the security interests were
attached:
(d) whether this Act provides otherwise for determining priority .
(2) A security interest may be—
(a) perfected by registration of a ﬁnance notice; or
(b) perfected by possession of the collateral; or
(c) perfected by control of the collateral; or
(d) automatically perfected.
17 What is perfection of security interest
(1) Perfection of a security interest in collateral means that the steps have been
taken that are necessary to optimise the priority of that security interest over the
interests of third parties.
(2) More than 1 security interest may be perfected in respect of the same collateral.
18 When security interest perfected
A security interest is perfected when—

(a) a purchase money security interest in consumer goods is automatically
perfected on attachment of the security interest:

perfected only by the secured party taking possession of the money:
(d) a security interest in a deposit account is perfected only by the secured
party having control of the deposit account.
21 Perfection in relation to proceeds
(1) On the disposal of collateral, a security interest attaches to the proceeds of the
collateral and is continuously perfected if the security interest in the collateral
was perfected.
(2) However, the security interest in proceeds becomes unperfected 15 working
days after the debtor receives the proceeds unless the proceeds are—
(a) identiﬁable cash proceeds; or
(b) described by the collateral description in the ﬁnance notice registered in
respect of the collateral.
(3) A security interest in proceeds must be treated as perfected at the time the
security interest in the collateral was perfected.

(3) For the purposes of perfection, a secured party is not in possession or control of
collateral that is in the actual or apparent possession or control of the debtor or
the debtor’s agent.
23 Continuity of perfection
(1) A security interest is continuously perfected for the purposes of this Act if it is
ﬁrst perfected in 1 manner and later perfected in another manner, with no
intervening period during which the security interest is unperfected.
(2) A continuously perfected security interest must be treated as perfected by the
method by which it was originally perfected.
(3) The assignment of a perfected security interest does not require the registration
of a new ﬁnance notice for perfection of the security interest to continue.
24 Lapse of perfection
Perfection of a security interest that is perfected by registration lapses at the end
of the period of ef fectiveness of the ﬁnance notice unless—
(a) the notice is continued by ﬁling a continuation notice; or
