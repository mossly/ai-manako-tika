of any of fence punishable by imprisonment, with a view to assisting the court in

respond satisfactorily to probation and whether any condition of probation
should be imposed.
(2) It is the duty of every probation of f icer—

to assisting their social rehabilitation and preventing the commission of
further of fences:

may also sentence that person to pay any ﬁne authorised by law .

it may in its discretion order, as part of the sentence, that on his or her release
from imprisonment he or she must be on probation for any period, not exceeding
1 year, speciﬁed by the High Court, and may impose any condition of probation
under section 8. In any such case that person is, on his or her release from

probation under this section is deemed to be a sentence or, where a ﬁne is
imposed, to be part of the sentence.

the High Court must notify the Secretary .
(6) Every probationer must be under the supervision of a probation of f icer in whose

be served on the probationer:
Provided that whenever an of fender is charged under section 10, any probation
of f icer may if they think ﬁt give notice to the probationer that if the probationer

her on probation and, in any case where the of fender was also sentenced to pay
a ﬁne, other than by sentencing him or her to pay a further ﬁne, in which a Judge

convicted of that of fence. If the of fender is not sentenced or otherwise dealt with
for that of fence he or she continues to be on probation.
12 Ef fect of subsequent sentence on probation
(1) Where any person released on probation under this Part is sentenced in respect
of any of fence to imprisonment for life or for a term of 1 year or more, the
probation is deemed to be terminated.
(2) Where any person released on probation under this Part is sentenced in respect
of any of fence to imprisonment for less than 1 year, the term of his or her
probation continues to run while he or she is detained under the sentence, and
on his or her release from detention he or she continues to be on probation for
the then unexpired residue of that term, unless he or she is sooner discharged
from probation under this Part.
13 Discharge on expiry of probation

s 11LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS

her sentence.

17 V ariation or cancellation of Community Service Order
(1) Any Community Service Order may at any time, on the application of the
of fender or of the Controller, or of any probation of f icer in respect of any
probation ordered as part of that order, be varied or cancelled by the court.
(2) An order may be varied or cancelled under this section on the ground that there
has been a change of circumstances since the order was made or, if the court
considers that a continuation of the order is no longer necessary in the interests
of the community or the of fender, the order may be cancelled on that ground.
18 Report on conduct of of fender
Where any person has served in a Community Service Group and is later
brought before a court for any other of fence, any probation of f icer or the
Controller or any other of f icer of the Department of Justice may make a report
in writing to the court on the conduct of that person while he or she was in legal
custody under that order, and, where the report is made by a person other than
the probation of f icer, the provisions of section 5 of the principal Act apply with
the necessary modiﬁcations.

Controller or Deputy Controller supervising the employment.
20 Ef fect of subsequent convictions
If any person serving a term of Community Service is convicted of another
of fence and sentenced imprisonment for life or for a term of 1 year or more, the
Community Service Order is deemed to be terminated; but, in the case of any
other sentence imposed, the court by which the person is sentenced or otherwise
dealt with may , unless any application pursuant to section 21 has been made to
that or any other Court, in its discretion make an order terminating the
Community Service Order. If the court makes no such order and the person
subject to the Community Service Order is sentenced to imprisonment for less
than 1 year, the term of the Community Service Order continues to run while he
or she is detained under the sentence of imprisonment, and on release from
imprisonment he or she continues to be subject to the Community Service Order
for any unexpired residue of the term.
21 Application for substituted sentence
(1) If any person who is subject to a Community Service Order is convicted of any
of fence, committed after the order was made, which is punishable by
imprisonment (whether or not the person subject to the order was sentenced to
pay a ﬁne), any probation of f icer may , unless the Community Service Order has
been terminated under section 20, apply to the court, in accordance with this
section and section 22, to substitute another sentence for the Community
Service Order.
(2) Before the hearing by the court of any application under this section for the
substitution of another sentence for a Community Service Order, the probation
of f icer making the application must cause notice of the application to be served
on the person subject to the Community Service Order.
(3) Despite anything in subsection (1) or (2), if the person who is subject to a
Community Service Order is charged with an of fence against section 19(1), the
probation of f icer, if he or she thinks ﬁt, may before the hearing of the charge
give notice to the person charged that if he or she is convicted of the of fence
charged, the court will be asked to substitute another sentence for the
Community Service Order. If the person so notiﬁed is convicted of the of fence
charged, the probation of f icer may , unless the Community Service Order has
been terminated under section 20, substitute another sentence for the
s 19LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 638,206

Community Service Order, and it is not necessary for the probation of f icer to
cause any subsequent notice of the application to be served on that person.
22 Court empowered to substitute sentence
(1) If the application made under section 21 is dealt with by a Judge other than the
one who made the Community Service Order in respect of the of fender, the
Judge must, before determining the application, make such inquiries as to the
circumstances of the case as the Judge considers reasonable, and may if he or
she thinks ﬁt, hear any evidence relevant to these circumstances.
(2) The Judge by whom the application is heard under this section may , if he or she
thinks ﬁt, having regard to the gravity of the of fence in respect of which the
order was made, the amount of any ﬁne cancelled by the order, the extent (if
any) to which the of fender has virtually served the order (including the payment
of any ﬁne imposed with the order) and any other circumstance which the Judge
thinks relevant—
(a) if the order was made pursuant to section 8, substitute for it any sentence
other than a Community Service Order which could have been imposed
on him or her at the time he or she was ordered to serve in a Community
Service Group; or
(b) if the order was made pursuant to section 9, substitute for it a sentence to
a term of imprisonment not exceeding the maximum term for which he or
she could have been committed to prison if he or she had been so dealt
with under the Crimes Act 1969 instead of being ordered to serve in a
Community Service Group.
(3) When under this section a sentence is substituted for a Community Service
Order, the Community Service Order is deemed to be terminated.
