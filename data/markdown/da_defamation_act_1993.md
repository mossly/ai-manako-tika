Service 0140,301

against the person making the of fer in respect of the publication in
question (but without prejudice to any cause of action against any other
person jointly responsible for that publication):

otherwise provided by this section, it is a defence in any action by him or
her for defamation against the person making the of fer in respect of the

published by the defendant innocently in relation to the plaintif f and that
the of fer was made as soon as practicable after the defendant received
notice that they were or might be defamatory of the plaintif f, and has not
been withdrawn.
(2) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply in relation to the publication by any person of

Service 0 140,302

and, if no such action or proceedings as aforesaid are taken, the Court may , upon
application made by the party aggrieved, make any such order for the payment
of such costs and expenses as aforesaid as could be made in any such action or
proceedings.

(a) that the publisher did not intend to publish them of and concerning that
other person, and did not know of circumstances by virtue of which they

was concerned with the contents of the publication.

charges against the plaintif f, a defence of justiﬁcation shall not fail by reason

true do not materially injure the plaintif f’s reputation having regard to the truth
of the remaining charges.

of fact and partly of expression of opinion, a defence of fair comment shall not
fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if the
expression of opinion is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged
or referred to in the words complained of as are proved.

defamatory matter
(1) When an action has been commenced by any person in respect of the
publication of defamatory matter in a newspaper, no other action may thereafter
be commenced by the same person in respect of the publication at any time
before the commencement of the ﬁrst-mentioned action of the same or
substantially the same defamatory matter in any other newspaper, unless that
other action is commenced on or within 30 days after the date of the
commencement of the ﬁrst-mentioned action.

not necessary for the defendant to plead this matter by way of defence, but the
same may be given in evidence as defence on the trial of the action.

the publication of the same or substantially the same defamatory matter in
dif ferent newspapers, the plaintif f must as soon as practicable give to the
defendant in each of the actions such notice of the existence of the other actions
as is reasonably suf f icient to enable each defendant to make application for the
consolidation of the actions under the provisions of section 11.
(2) If the plaintif f makes default in giving notice as set out in subsection (1) to any
defendant, that defendant may apply to the Court to dismiss or stay the action,
and the Court may , if in its discretion it thinks ﬁt to do so, dismiss or stay the
action accordingly .
11 Consolidation of actions on application of defendants
(1) The Court, upon the application of the defendants in 2 or more actions brought
in that Court by one and the same person in respect of the publication of the
same or substantially the same defamatory matter, may make an order for the
consolidation of those actions so that they are tried together; and after any such
order has been made, and before the trial of the actions, the defendant in any
other action brought in respect of the same or substantially the same defamatory
matter is also entitled to be joined in a common action upon a joint application
being made by that defendant and the defendants in the actions already
consolidated.
(2) In an action consolidated under the provisions of this section the Judge shall
assess the whole amount of the damages (if any) in one sum, but a separate
decision shall be given for or against each defendant in the same way as if the
actions consolidated had been tried separately; and if a decision is given against
the defendants in more than one of the actions so consolidated, the Judge shall
proceed to apportion the amount of damages so found between and against those
defendants; and the Judge at the trial, if he or she awards to the plaintif f the costs
of the action, shall thereupon make such order as he or she deems just for the
apportionment of those costs between and against those defendants.
(3) Every action consolidated under the provisions of this section shall be heard at
such time and place as a Judge of the High Court may order.
(4) This section applies to actions for slander of title, slander of goods, or other
malicious falsehood as it applies to actions for defamation; and references in
this section to the same or substantially the same defamatory matter are to be
construed accordingly .
12 Public apology in mitigation of damages
In an action for defamation the defendant may prove in mitigation of damages
that he or she made or of fered a public apology to the plaintif f for the
defamation before the commencement of the action, or, if the action was
commenced before there was a reasonable opportunity of making or of fering
such an apology , as soon afterwards as he or she had a reasonable opportunity
of doing so.
13 Other evidence in mitigation of damages
In an action for defamation the defendant may prove in mitigation of damages
that the plaintif f has already recovered damages, or has brought an action for
s 10LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 140,304

damages, or has received or agreed to receive compensation, in respect of any
other publication by the same or any other person of the same or substantially
the same defamatory matter.
14 Agreements for indemnity
An agreement for indemnifying any person against civil liability for defamation
in respect of the publication of any matter is not unlawful, unless at the time of
the publication that person knows that the matter is defamatory and does not
reasonably believe that there is a good defence to any action brought upon it.

(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the publication of any such report or
other matter as is mentioned in the Schedule is privileged in any civil or
criminal proceeding unless the publication is proved to be made with malice.

part of any programme or service provided by means of a broadcasting station,
of any such report or matter as is mentioned in Part 2 of the Schedule, the
provisions of this section are not a defence if it is proved that the defendant has
been requested by the plaintif f to publish in the manner in which the original
publication was made, a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation or
contradiction, and has refused or neglected to do so, or has done so in a manner
not adequate or not reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.
(3) Nothing in this section is to be construed as protecting the publication—
(a) of any report or other matter the publication of which is prohibited by
law:
(b) of any such report or other matter as is mentioned in Part 2 of the
Schedule, unless it is of public concern and the publication of it is for the
public beneﬁt.
(4) Nothing in this section is to be construed as limiting or abridging any privilege
subsisting immediately before the commencement of this Act.

(1) Any person who is a defendant in any civil or criminal proceeding commenced
or prosecuted in respect of the publication of any report, paper, votes, or
proceedings by that person, or by their servant, by or under the authority of
Parliament may bring before the Court in which the proceeding is so
commenced or prosecuted (ﬁrst giving 24 hours notice of his or her intention to
do so to the plaintif f or prosecutor in the proceeding or to their solicitor) a
certiﬁcate under the hand of the Speaker of Parliament stating that the report,
paper, votes, or proceedings, as the case may be, in respect of which the
proceeding is commenced or prosecuted were published by that person, or by
their servant, by order or under the authority of Parliament.
(2) Every such certiﬁcate must be accompanied by an af f idavit verifying the
certiﬁcate.

proceeding, and the proceeding shall be deemed to be ﬁnally determined by
virtue of this section.

without malice
In any civil or criminal proceeding commenced or prosecuted in respect of the
publication of any extract from or abstract of any such report, paper, votes or
proceedings as are referred to in section 16, the defendant may give in evidence
the report, paper, votes, or proceedings, and show that the extract or abstract was
published in good faith and without malice; and if that is the opinion of the
Judge a verdict of not guilty must be entered for the defendant.
19 Evidence as to publisher or printer
Upon the trial of any civil or criminal proceeding commenced or prosecuted in
respect of the publication of any defamatory matter in any book or printed
document, or in any number or part of a newspaper or other periodical, any
printed statement contained in the book, document, number, or part that the
same is published or printed by the defendant is, in the absence of proof to the
contrary , evidence of the truth of that statement.
20 Court may give a general verdict in civil or criminal cases
Upon the trial of any civil or criminal proceeding commenced or prosecuted in
respect of the publication of any defamatory matter, the Judge may give a
general verdict for or against the defendant upon the whole matter put in issue,
and is not required to give a verdict against any defendant merely on proof of
the matter alleged to be defamatory and on proof of the sense ascribed to it in

ﬁnding a special verdict in their discretion, as in other cases.
