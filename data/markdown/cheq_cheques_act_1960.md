cheque drawn on him which is not indorsed or is irregularly indorsed, he shall
not, in doing so, incur any liability by reason only of the absence of, or

course.
(2) Where a banker in good faith and in the ordinary course of business pays any
such instrument as the following, namely—
(a) a document issued by a customer of his which, though not a bill of
exchange, is intended to enable a person to obtain payment from him of
the sum mentioned in the document; or
(b) a draft payable on demand drawn by him upon himself whether payable
at the head of f ice or some other of f ice of his bank—
he shall not, in doing so, incur any liability by reason only of the absence of, or
irregularity in, indorsement, and the payment shall discharge the instrument.
3 Rights of bankers collecting cheques not indorsed by holders
A banker who gives value for, or has a lien on, a cheque payable to order which
the holder delivers to him for collection without indorsing it shall have such
rights (if any) as he would have had if, upon delivery , the holder had indorsed
it in blank.
4 Unindorsed cheques as evidence of payment
An unindorsed cheque which appears to have been paid by a banker on whom
it is drawn shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary , be suf f icient evidence
of the receipt by the payee of the sum payable by the cheque.
5 Protection of bankers collecting payment of cheques

(a) receives payment for a customer of an instrument to which this section
applies; or
(b) having credited a customer’s account with the amount of any such
instrument receives payment thereof for himself—

of having received payment thereof.

payable at the head of f ice or some other of f ice of his bank.
