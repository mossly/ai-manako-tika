33 Members of same practice
Regulation 31 applies, with any necessary modiﬁcations, whenever land agents
who are members of the same practice act for more than 1 party .
34 Conﬂicting interests
(1) A land agent must not act or continue to act if there is a conﬂict, or a risk of a
conﬂict, between the interests of the land agent and the interests of a client for
whom the land agent is acting or proposing to act.
(2) Where a land agent has an interest that touches on the matter in respect of which
regulated services are required, the existence of that interest must be disclosed
to the client or prospective client irrespective of whether a conﬂict exists.
(3) A land agent must not act for a client in any transaction in which the land agent
has an interest unless the matter is not contentious and the interests of the land
agent and the client correspond in all respects.
(4) A land agent must not enter into any ﬁnancial, business, or property transaction
or relationship with a client if there is a possibility of the relationship of
conﬁdence and trust between land agent and client being compromised.
(5) A land agent who enters into any ﬁnancial, business, or property transaction or
relationship with a client must advise the client of the right to receive
independent advice in respect of the matter and explain to the client that the land
agent must cease to act for the client should a conﬂict of interest arise.
(6) Subclause (5) does not apply where—
(a) the client and the land agent are relatives; or
(b) the transaction is a contract for the supply by the client of goods or
services in the normal course of the client’s business; or
(c) a land agent subscribes for or otherwise acquires shares in a listed
company for which the land agent’s practice acts.

(7) In this rule, a land agent is deemed to be a party to a transaction if the
transaction is between entities that are related to the land agent by control
(including a trusteeship, directorship, or the holding of a power of attorney) or
ownership (including a shareholding), or between parties to whom the land
agent or client is related.
35 Conﬂicting business interests
(1) A land agent must not engage in a business or professional activity other than
the practice of land agent where the business or professional activity would or
could reasonably be expected to compromise the discharge of the land agent’s
professional obligations.
(2) Where a land agent provides, or intends to provide, services to clients other than
regulated services, the services must—
(a) be associated with the provision of regulated services; and
(b) be provided by the land agent’s practice or by an entity in which the land
agent or the land agent’s practice has a controlling interest.
36 Third party conﬂicts of interest
(1) A land agent must not act if there is a conﬂict of interest or an appearance of a
conﬂict of interest between a client and a third party to whom the land agent is
related.
(2) Where a person who is a relative of the land agent has an interest in the matter
being dealt with or proposed to be dealt with on behalf of the client, the
existence of that relationship and the nature of the interest must be disclosed to
the client or prospective client irrespective of whether an actual conﬂict of
interest exists.
(3) A land agent is not precluded from acting for a client solely because another
member of the land agent’s practice is a relative of a person whose interests
conﬂict with the interests of the land agent’s client.
(4) Where land agents are relatives of each other they must not act for dif ferent
parties in a matter unless the clients of both land agents give their informed
consent to their respective land agents acting. Where land agents who are
relatives of each other are engaged by their respective clients before the
relationship is established, then, in the absence of both clients’ consent to their
respective land agents continuing to act, the land agent engaged later in time
must cease to act.
(5) A land agent is not precluded from acting for a client because another member
of his or her practice is related to the land agent acting for another party to the
transaction.
37 Personal relationships
A land agent must not enter into an intimate personal relationship with a client
where to do so would or could be inconsistent with the trust and conﬁdence
reposed in the land agent by the client.
38 Collateral rewards
Except in respect of arrangements under which a third party has agreed to pay
or contribute to normal fees payable by a client with the knowledge and consent
of that client, a land agent must not directly or indirectly of fer to, or receive
