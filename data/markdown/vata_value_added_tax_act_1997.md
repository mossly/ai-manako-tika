Registration
12 Registration of persons making taxable supplies
(1) Subject to this section, every person who carries on a taxable activity and is not
already registered becomes liable to be registered under this Act—
(a) at the end of any month if the total value of supplies made in the Cook
Islands by the person in the year which ends with that end of that month
in the course of carrying on taxable activities has exceeded $40,000 (or
such other amount as the Queen’s Representative may from time to time,
by Order in Executive Council, stipulate):
(b) at the start of any month if there are reasonable grounds for believing that
the total value of supplies made in the Cook Islands by the person in the
year which starts at that start of that month in the course of carrying on
taxable activities will exceed the registration threshold amount.
(2) In determining whether the total value of supplies exceeds the registration
threshold amount—
(a) the value of exempt supplies will be disregarded; and
(b) the value of supplies will be disregarded if and to the extent that the
Collector is satisﬁed that the supply is solely as a consequence of—
(i) any cessation of, or substantial and permanent reduction in the
size or scale of, a taxable activity carried on by the person; or
(ii) the replacement of any plant or other capital asset used in any
taxable activity carried on by the person.
(3) Every person who, under subsection (1) becomes liable to be registered must
apply to the Collector in the form prescribed by the Collector for registration
under this Act within 21 days of becoming so liable and must provide the
Collector with such other information as the Collector may consider relevant.
(4) Despite subsections (1) and (3), every person who satisﬁes the Collector that—
(a) the person is carrying on a taxable activity; or
(b) the person intends to carry on a taxable activity from a speciﬁed date,
and—
(c) the value of supplies to be made by the person in the course of carrying
on the taxable activities is likely to exceed $20,000 for the year from the
date of the application or from the speciﬁed date,
may apply to the Collector in the form prescribed by the Collector for
registration under this Act, and must provide the Collector with such other
information as the Collector may consider relevant.
(5) If a person has applied for registration under subsection (3) or (4) and the
Collector is satisﬁed that the person is eligible to be registered under this Act,
the person must be registered for the purposes of this Act with ef fect from such
date as the Collector determines.
(6) If a person has not applied for registration under subsection (3) and the
Collector is satisﬁed that the person is liable to be registered under this Act, the
person will be deemed to be registered for the purposes of this Act with ef fect
from the date on which the person ﬁrst became liable to be registered under this
Service 0696,801

Act (unless the Collector determines that it would be equitable for the person to
be deemed to be registered from a later date stipulated by the Collector).
(7) Section 6 applies to determine the value of supplies for the purposes of this
section except that no regard will be had to any amount of consideration payable
in order to recover tax charged in respect of the supplies.
(8) The value of supplies of imported services received by a person is taken into
account in determining whether the person exceeds the registration threshold
and, for this purpose, the requirement in section 4A(1)(a) is ignored.

value of supplies to be made in the Cook Islands by the person in the year which
starts at that time will be below the registration threshold amount.
(2) If a registered person ceases to be liable to be registered, the person may request
the Collector in writing to cancel the person’s registration.
(3) If the Collector is satisﬁed that a registered person who has applied for
cancellation is no longer liable to be registered, the Collector will cancel the
person’s registration with ef fect from the last day of the return period following
the period in which the application for cancellation was made (or with ef fect
from such other date as the Collector may stipulate).

Assessment of tax
21 Assessment of tax
(1) The Collector may , from time to time, from returns furnished under this Act or
from other information, make assessments of the amount which the Collector
considers is the tax payable under this Act by any person.
(2) If—
(a) a person is not satisﬁed with a return furnished by the person or by
another person under section 15(2) in respect of goods supplied to satisfy
a debt owed by the person; and
(b) the person requests the Collector to alter the return; and
(c) the Collector has not already made an assessment of the tax payable in
respect of the return period to which the return relates,—
the Collector will make an assessment of the amount that the Collector
considers is the tax payable under this Act.
(3) Any person assessed by the Collector as being liable to tax will be liable to pay
the tax assessed except to the extent that the person establishes on objection that
the tax is not payable.
(4) The Collector may from time to time amend an assessment to ensure its
correctness.
(5) If an assessment or amended assessment is made under this section, the
Collector will—
(a) cause notice of the assessment or amended assessment to be given to the
person liable to pay the tax; and
(b) in the case of an assessment in respect of a return under section 15(2),
send a copy of the assessment to whichever, of the person whose goods
were supplied and the person selling the goods, is not the person
assessed,—
but failure to give notice will not invalidate the assessment.
(6) Where V A T calculated in a return is altered by the Collector, and the alteration
results in further V A T to pay after the date for payment for the tax, the Collector
may ﬁx a new date for the payment of the tax, but only if the Collector is
satisﬁed that the person liable to pay the tax has not been guilty of wilful neglect
or default in making the return necessary to make the amended assessment.
(7) For the purposes of Parts 4, 7, and 10, if—
(a) a person, not being a registered person, supplies goods, and services and
represents that tax is payable on that supply; or
(b) a person furnishes, or makes default in furnishing, a return required to be
made by the person under section 15(2),—
the person will be treated as being a registered person and any tax represented
to be payable on the relevant supply by the person will be tax payable by the
person.
