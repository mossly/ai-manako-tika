Schedule
s 57
Code of ethics
1. A practitioner must at all times maintain the honour and dignity of his or her
profession. The practitioner must, in his or her practice, abstain from any behaviour
which may tend to discredit the profession.
2. A practitioner must preserve independence in the discharge of his or her professional
duty . A practitioner practising on his or her own account or in partnership where
permissible, must not engage in any other business or occupation if by doing as he or
she may cease to be independent.
3. A practitioner must treat his or her professional colleagues with the utmost courtesy
and fairness.
4. A practitioner who undertakes to render assistance to a foreign colleague must always
keep in mind that his or her foreign colleague has to depend on him or her to a much
larger extent than in the case of another practitioner of the same country . Therefore his
or her responsibility is much greater, both when giving advice and when handling a
case.
5. It is improper for a practitioner to accept a case unless he or she can handle it
promptly and with due competence, without undue interference by the pressure of
other work.
6. Any oral or written communication between practitioners must be accorded
conﬁdentiality , unless agreed otherwise by a client, or as may be required by law .
7. A practitioner must always maintain due respect towards the Court. A practitioner
must without fear defend the interests of his or her client and without regard to any
unpleasant consequences to himself or herself or to any other person.
8. A practitioner must never knowingly give to the Court incorrect factual information,
or advice which is to his or her knowledge contrary to the law .
9. It is considered improper for a practitioner to communicate about a particular case or
matter directly with any person whom he or she knows to be represented in that case
or matter by another practitioner, without the latter’s consent.
10. A practitioner should never solicit business and he or she should never consent to
handle a case other than at the direct request of the party concerned, unless the
practitioner is satisﬁed that the person making the request is authorised by the party
concerned to do so. However, it is proper for a practitioner to handle a case which is
assigned to him or her by the High Court or other tribunal, or which is forwarded to
him or her by another practitioner.
11. A practitioner must at all times give his or her client a candid opinion, and must render
his or her assistance with scrupulous care and diligence.
12. Subject to rule 13, a practitioner is at any time free to refuse to take instructions in
respect of any matter, but should only withdraw from a matter during its course for
good cause, and if possible in such a manner that the client’s interests are not
adversely af fected.
13. It is a fundamental principle that every practitioner who holds themselves out as being
available to appear in Court has a duty not to refuse a brief to appear in a class of case
in which they profess to practise on the ground that they disapprove of the client, the
client’s conduct or the cause. In particular the practitioner has an obligation not to
Service 015,801

refuse the brief either because the client or the cause is unpopular or because
acceptance of the brief may , in the eyes of people who do not understand the
obligation of the practitioner, cause criticism on that account.
14. The loyal defence of a client’s case may never cause an advocate to be other than
perfectly candid, subject to any lawful right or privilege to the contrary which his or
her clients choose him or her to exercise.
15. A practitioner must when in the client’s interests, endeavour to reach a solution by
settlement out of Court rather than start legal proceedings. A practitioner should never
stir up litigation.
16. A practitioner should not acquire a ﬁnancial interest in the subject matter of a case or
matter which he or she is conducting. Neither should the practitioner, directly or
indirectly , acquire property about which litigation is pending before the Court in
which he or she practices.
17. A practitioner should not represent conﬂicting interests in any litigation, and should
only do so in other matters where his or her clients have had the conﬂicting interest
disclosed to them and they do not object. This also applies to all members of a ﬁrm
or partnership of practitioners.
18. A practitioner should never disclose, unless lawfully ordered to do so by the Court or
as required by law , what has been communicated to the practitioner in his or her
capacity as a practitioner, even after he or she has ceased to be the client’s counsel.
This duty extends to the practitioner’s partners, to practitioners assisting him or her,
and to his or her employees.
19. In pecuniary matters a practitioner must be most punctual and diligent. The
practitioner should never mingle funds of others with the practitioner’s own and he or
she should at all times (subject to any lien) be able to refund money he or she holds
in trust for others.
20. A practitioner must not retain money he or she has received for his or her client for
longer than is absolutely necessary .
21. A practitioner may require that a deposit is made to cover his or her expenses, but the
deposit should be in accordance with the estimated amount of his or her charges and
the probable expenses and labour required. The practitioner’s right to ask for a deposit
or to demand payment for his or her services, (failing which he or she may withdraw
from a case or refuse to handle it), should never be exercised at a moment when the
client or prospective client may be unable to ﬁnd other assistance in time to prevent
irreparable damage being done.
22. A practitioner must never forget that he or she should put ﬁrst not his or her right to
compensation for his or her services, but the interests of his or her client and the
exigencies of the administration of justice.
23. The practitioner’s fee should be ﬁxed on a consideration of the amount involved in or
the magnitude of the controversy or matter, and the interest in it of the client, the time
and labour involved; the reasonable overheads and degree of experience of the
practitioner, and all other personal and factual circumstances prevailing.
24. A practitioner who engages a foreign colleague to advise on a case or to co-operate
in handling it, is responsible for the payment of the latter’s charges in the absence of
express agreement to the contrary . When a practitioner directs a client to a foreign
colleague, the practitioner is not responsible for the payment of the latter’s charges,
but neither is he or she entitled to a share of the fee of the foreign colleague.
25. No practitioner should permit his or her professional services or his or her name to be
used in any way which would make it possible for persons to practise law who are not
SchLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 15,802

legally authorised to do so. No practitioner may delegate to a legally unqualiﬁed
person not in his or her employ and control, any function which is by law only to be
performed by a qualiﬁed practitioner.
