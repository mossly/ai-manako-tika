12A Power of infant to enter into contract with prior approval of Magistrate’s
Court
(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act or in any other Act or any rule of law , no

this section on behalf of the infant by a Magistrate’s Court.
(2) Any application to a Magistrate’s Court under this section may be made by the
infant on whose behalf the contract is to be approved or by a parent or guardian
of the infant.
(3) The Court may , in its discretion, refer any such application to a parent or
guardian of the infant, or, where the Court deems it necessary for the purposes
of the application, to a solicitor nominated by the Court, or to the Public Trustee
or the Maori Trustee, or to any other person, and may order the applicant to pay
the reasonable costs and expenses of any person to whom the application is so
referred. Any person to whom the application is so referred may ﬁle a report in
the Magistrate’s Court setting out the results of his consideration and
examination of the application and making in respect thereof such
recommendations as he thinks proper, and may appear and be heard at the
hearing of the application; but no such person shall be under any obligation to
consider or examine any such application until his reasonable costs and
expenses have been paid or secured to his satisfaction.

application, or protection of the moneys paid or to be paid, or otherwise.

Court may , in its discretion, order that section 66 of the Public Trust Of f ice
Act 1957 shall apply with respect to the claim as if it were the subject of
proceedings in the Court, and in any such case that section shall apply
accordingly .
