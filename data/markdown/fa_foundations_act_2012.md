Application of laws and judgments to a foundation
36 Cook Islands law to prevail in respect of foundations
(1) A question that arises in respect of—
(a) a foundation; or
(b) the dedication of assets to a foundation, must be determined in
accordance with the law of the Cook Islands without reference to the law
of a jurisdiction outside the Cook Islands.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the question may be a question as to—
(a) the capacity of the founder of a foundation to seek the establishment of
the foundation or the capacity of a dedicator to dedicate assets to it; or
(b) the validity , interpretation or ef fect of the foundation instrument or
foundation rules or of an amendment of them; or
(c) the administration of the foundation, whether it is conducted in the Cook
Islands or elsewhere, including questions as to the functions, appointment
and removal of a person appointed under the foundation rules; and or
(d) the existence and extent of functions in respect of a foundation, including
(but not limited to) powers of amendment, revocation and appointment,
and the validity of the exercise of such a function.
(3) However, subsection (1)—
(a) does not validate the dedication of assets to a foundation with property
that is not—
(i) owned by a founder or dedicator:
(ii) the subject of a power of disposition vested in a founder or
dedicator; and
(b) does not af fect the recognition of the law of a jurisdiction outside the
Cook Islands in determining whether a founder or a dedicator is or was
the owner of property or the holder of such a power; and
(c) is subject to an express provision to the contrary in the foundation
instrument or foundation rules; and
(d) does not, as regards the capacity of a body corporate, af fect the
recognition of the law of its place of incorporation; and
(e) does not af fect the recognition of the law of a jurisdiction outside the
Cook Islands prescribing (without reference to the existence of the
foundation or the terms of its foundation instrument and foundation rules)
the formalities for the disposition of property; and
(f) does not validate a trust or disposition of immoveable property situate in
a jurisdiction outside the Cook Islands that is invalid under the law of that
jurisdiction; and
(g) does not validate a testamentary disposition that is invalid under the law
of the testator’s last domicile.
37 Exclusion of foreign law
(1) Subject to section 39, neither of the following is void, voidable, liable to be set
aside, invalid or subject to an implied condition because of a reason speciﬁed in
subsection (3), (4), or (6)—
(a) the establishment of a foundation; or
(b) the dedication of assets to a foundation.
s 37 FOUNDA TIONS ACT 2012
Service 0420,901

(2) Subject to section 39, none of the following is subject to an obligation or
liability or deprived of a right, claim or interest arising from or under the
foundation because of a reason speciﬁed in subsection (3), (4), or (6)—
(a) a foundation:
(b) a founder of a foundation:
(c) an assignee of a right a founder of a foundation may have had in respect
of the foundation or its assets:
(d) a dedicator to the foundation:
(e) a person appointed under the foundation rules:
(f) a beneﬁciary under a foundation:
(g) a third party .
(3) The ﬁrst reason is that the law of a jurisdiction outside the Cook Islands—
(a) prohibits or does not recognise foundations; or
(b) prohibits the dedication of assets to foundations.
(4) The second reason is that—
(a) the establishment of a foundation; or
(b) the dedication of assets to a foundation,
avoids or defeats or potentially avoids or defeats a right, claim, interest,
obligation or liability conferred or imposed by the law of a jurisdiction outside
the Cook Islands on a person as the result of a factor mentioned in
subsection (5).
(5) The factors are—
(a) the existence of a personal relationship between a person referred to in
subsection (4) and
(i) a founder; or
(ii) a dedicator; or
(iii) an assignee of a right a founder of a foundation may have had in
respect of the foundation or its assets; or
(iv) a beneﬁciary under the foundation; or
(b) the existence of foreign heirship rights.
(6) The third reason is that—
(a) the establishment of a foundation; or
(b) the dedication of assets to a foundation,
contravenes or potentially contravenes a rule of law or a judicial or
administrative judgment, order or action of a jurisdiction outside the Cook
Islands intended to recognise, protect, enforce or give ef fect to a right, claim,
interest, obligation or liability mentioned in subsection (4).
(7) Despite any other enactment or rule of law , a judgment or order of a court of a
jurisdiction outside the Cook Islands that concerns a question mentioned in
section 36(1) is not—
(a) to be recognised, enforced or otherwise given ef fect to; or
(b) to give rise to a right, obligation or liability or raise any estoppel,
if the court in question in giving the judgment or making the order failed to take
the operation of section 36 and this section into account.
38 Bankruptcy
Despite any provision of the law of the founder’s domicile or place of ordinary
residence or the founder’s current place of incorporation, a foundation and a
disposition to a foundation is void or voidable in the event of the foundation’s
s 37LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 420,902

bankruptcy , insolvency or liquidation (other than in the case of an international
company registered pursuant to the International Companies Act 1981–82 that is
in liquidation) or in any action or proceedings at the suit of creditors of the
founder but remains valid and subsisting and takes ef fect according to its tenor
subject to the provisions of section 39.
39 Fraud
(1) Where it is proven beyond reasonable doubt by a creditor that a foundation
established or property disposed to a foundation—
(a) was so established or disposed by or on behalf of the founder with
principal intent to defraud that creditor of the founder; and
(b) did at the time such establishment or disposition took place render the
founder insolvent or without property by which that creditor’s claim (if
successful) could have been satisﬁed,
then such establishment or disposition is not void or voidable and the foundation
is liable to satisfy the creditor’s claim out of the property which, but for the
establishment or disposition, would have been available to satisfy the creditor’s
claim and such liability must only be to the extent of the interest that the founder
had in the property prior to establishment or disposition and any accumulation
to the property (if any) subsequent thereto.
(2) In determining whether a foundation established, or a disposition, has rendered
the founder insolvent or without property by which a creditor’s claim (if
successful) may be satisﬁed, regard must be had to the fair market value of the
founder’s property , (not being property of or relating to the foundation) at the
time immediately after the establishment or the disposition referred to in
subsection (1)(b) and in the event that the fair market value of such property
exceeded the value of the creditor’s claim, at that time, after the establishment
or disposition, the foundation so established or the disposition must for all
purposes be deemed not to have been so established or the property disposed of
with intent to defraud the creditor.
(3) A foundation established and a disposition to such foundation is for all purposes
deemed not to have been so established, or the property disposed of with intent
to defraud a creditor—
(a) if established or the disposition takes place after the expiration of 2 years
from the date that creditor’s cause of action accrued; or
(b) where established or the disposition takes place before the expiration of
2 years from the date that the creditor’s cause of action accrued, that
creditor fails to commence in a court of competent jurisdiction
proceedings in respect of that creditor’s cause of action before the
expiration of 1 year from the date such establishment or disposition took
place,
provided that this subsection does not have ef fect if at the time of establishment,
or disposition, as the case may be, proceedings in respect of that creditor’s cause
of action against that founder have already been commenced in a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(4) A foundation established and a disposition of property to such foundation is for
all purposes deemed not to have been so established, or the property disposed of
with intent to defraud a creditor if the establishment or disposition of property
took place before that creditor’s cause of action accrued.
s 39 FOUNDA TIONS ACT 2012
Service 0420,903

(5) A founder must not have imputed to him an intent to defraud a creditor, solely
by reason that the founder—
(a) has established a foundation or has disposed of property to such
foundation within 2 years from the date of that creditor’s cause of action
accruing; or
(b) is a beneﬁciary , enforcer, or council member of the foundation; or
(c) has established a foundation, or has disposed of property to such
foundation, at a time when proceedings in respect of that creditor’s cause
of action against that founder have already been commenced in a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(6) Where a foundation is liable to satisfy a creditor’s claim in the manner provided
for in subsection (1)—
(a) the creditor’s rights to recovery are limited to that property referred to in
subsection (1), or to the proceeds of that property , to the exclusion of any
other property of the foundation:
(b) where the foundation is unable to satisfy the creditor’s claim by reason of
the fact that the property referred to in subsection (1) has been disposed
of, other than to a bona ﬁde purchaser for value, then any such
disposition is void.
(7) For the purpose of this section the onus of proof of the founder’s intent to
defraud the creditor lies on the creditor.
(8) For the purposes of this section and section 40—
(a) the date of the cause of action accruing is the date of that act or omission
which is relied upon to either partly or wholly establish the cause of
action, and if there is more than 1 act or the omission is a continuing one,
the date of the ﬁrst act or the date that the omission has ﬁrst occurred, as
the case may be, is the date that the cause of action has accrued; and
(b) the term cause of action means the earliest cause of action capable of
assertion by a creditor against the founder of a foundation by which that
creditor has established (or may establish) an enforceable claim against
that founder; and
(c) where a creditor has, or asserts, or could have asserted, multiple or
successive causes of action against a founder (whether by virtue of the
nature of the relevant circumstances of the case, or by reason of having
attained the status of a judgement creditor in respect of 1 or more of such
causes of action, or by reason of asserting or being able to assert an
allegedly fraudulent settlement of or disposition to a foundation, or
otherwise), the entitlement of such a creditor to relief under this section
must be determined, and the periods referred to in this section must be
calculated, with reference to 1 only of the creditor’s causes of action,
being that cause of action which accrued ﬁrst in time in accordance with
paragraph (b); and
(d) nothing in paragraph (b) or (c) applies so as to af fect the right or
requirement of a creditor to commence separate proceedings under this
section in relation to a cause of action which is separate from and
independent of another cause of action where the court is satisﬁed,
having regard to paragraph (c), that both the circumstances out of which
the cause of action arose and the subject matter of that cause of action are
wholly unrelated to those of the other cause of action.
(9) The provisions of this section apply to all civil actions and proceedings brought
s 39LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 420,904

in the court in which fraud, deceit, unconscionable conduct or any other
inequitable conduct however described or any species of unjust enrichment is
alleged, against any person (whether a party to the proceedings or not) with
regard to the establishment of a foundation or the disposition of property to such
a foundation, or receipt of property by or for such a foundation (or subsequent
disposition of property from such a foundation with the intention of prejudicing
creditors of the founder of such foundation), and the remedy conferred by
subsection (1) is the sole remedy available in such an action or proceedings, to
the exclusion of any other relief or remedy against any party to the relevant
action or proceeding.
(10) The provisions of this section operate to the exclusion of any other remedy ,
principle or rule of law , whether provided for by statute, or founded in equity or
in common law including, for the avoidance of doubt, the imposition of a
constructive trust upon any interested party or the recognition and enforcement
of any constructive trust imposed or recognised by the laws of any other
jurisdiction.
(11) The provisions of this section apply to every foundation, and to every
foundation which having been registered as a foundation, is no longer so
registered, and in respect of all dispositions to such a foundation.
(12) For the purposes of this section creditor means a creditor of the founder and
includes any person who alleges a cause of action against a founder.
(13) A creditor seeking to enforce a claim under this section in reliance on a foreign
judgement may not enforce such claim until such time as it can demonstrate to
the reasonable satisfaction of the court that—
(a) it has exhausted all remedies available to it against the founder’s
remaining property; and
(b) all rights of appeal against that foreign judgement have been exhausted.
(14) For the purposes of assessing the liability of a foundation to a creditor under this
section, where the amount of that creditor’s claim against the founder is, wholly
or partly , in any way related to or evidenced by a foreign judgement, the court
in making any award in favour of that creditor must disregard and exclude any
amount awarded in that foreign judgement to that creditor which comprise any
form of exemplary , vindictive, retributory or punitive damages (by whatever
name), or is an amount of damages arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise
multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage (which
types of damage are in this section together called punitive damages ).
(15) The burden of proof is on a creditor to establish that an amount awarded in a
foreign judgement does not wholly or partly comprise punitive damages.
(16) Subsection (14) does not apply if, at the time of settlement, establishment, or
disposition, as the case may be, an award of punitive damages has already been
made in a foreign judgement against a founder.
40 Commencement of proceedings
(1) No action or proceedings, whether pursuant to this Act or at common law or in
equity , to—
(a) set aside the establishment of any foundation; or
(b) set aside any disposition to any foundation; or

proceeding (including any injunction or order that has the ef fect of preventing
the exercise of, or the granting or restoring of, any right, duty , obligation or
power, or of preserving, granting custody of, or detaining or inspecting any
property , including for the avoidance of doubt any Anton Pillar order or any
Mareva injunction) unless the court having regard to the af f idavit ﬁled pursuant
