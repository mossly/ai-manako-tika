lessening competition in any telecommunications market, unless an
authorisation under section 10 applies.
(2) A practice or a contract, arrangement, or understanding is presumed, unless the
contrary is proved, to have the ef fect of substantially lessening competition in a
telecommunications market if it directly or indirectly—

service is of fered, where any 2 or more of the parties to that contract,
arrangement, or understanding are in competition with each other; or

service to or from a person or class of persons; or

(e) imposes unreasonable restrictions on whom another person may deal
with in a telecommunications market; or

a relevant measure of its cost for a substantial period of time such that a

from a telecommunications market, except where the person engaging in

to respond to price competition from rival suppliers; or
(g) involves the adoption of technical speciﬁcations or standards with the
purpose of preventing or hindering interoperability with another service
provider’s network or services.

result, or would be likely to result.

entered into or given ef fect to within the terms and conditions of an

42 Obligation to supply Regulated Access Services
(1) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), an Access Provider must, if requested to do
so by an Access Seeker —
(a) supply a Regulated Access Service to the Access Seeker in order that the
Access Seeker can provide its own telecommunications services to end
users; and
(b) permit interconnection, for the purpose of enabling the Access Seeker to
obtain the Regulated Access Service, of—
(i) any telecommunications network or network equipment that the
Access Provider owns or controls; with
(ii) any telecommunications network or network equipment that the
Access Seeker owns or controls.
(2) In meeting its obligations under subsection (1)(a), the Access Provider must
ensure that the quality of the service (including operations, ordering,
provisioning and fault rectiﬁcation) that it provides to the Access Seeker:
(a) is equivalent to that which the Access Provider provides itself; and
(b) is non-discriminatory as between the Access Seeker and any other Access
Seekers.
(3) A Regulated Access Service is provided to an equivalent quality of service, if—
(a) the Access Provider provides itself and the Access Seeker with the same
service; and
s 40LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 261,102

(b) the Access Provider delivers that service to itself and the Access Seeker
within the same timeframe and on the same terms and conditions
(including price and service levels); and

Seeker by means of the same systems and processes (including
operational support processes); and
(d) the Access Provider provides itself and the Access Seeker with the same
information about that service and any relevant systems and processes;
and
(e) the Access Seeker is able to use the systems and processes (including
operational support processes) to obtain the service in the same way , and
with the same degree of reliability and performance, as the Access
Provider enjoys when providing that service to itself.
(4) This section does not require the Access Provider to supply a Regulated Access
Service to an Access Seeker if—
(a) the Access Provider has reasonable grounds to consider that the Access
Seeker would be unwilling or unable to comply with the terms and
conditions applicable to the Regulated Access Service; or
(b) if the Access Provider has reasonable grounds to consider that the Access
Seeker would be unwilling or unable to protect—
(i) the integrity of a telecommunications network; or
(ii) the safety of individuals working on, or using the services
supplied by means of, a telecommunications network; or
(c) if supplying the Regulated Access Service would—

forecast requirements, measured at the time when the request was
made and in accordance with any principles speciﬁed by the
Authority; or
(ii) impose on the Access Provider or any other person (other than an
Access Seeker) an unreasonable amount of the costs of extending
the coverage, or enhancing the capability , of the Access Provider’s
telecommunications network or services.

Part 6
Radio interference
33 Interpretation
In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,—
interfering equipment means any apparatus or equipment of any kind (whether
radio apparatus or equipment or not) that may generate electric waves (being
radio frequency energy) likely to interfere with radiocommunications; and
includes an electric power line belonging to an electric power supply authority .
34 Limit of intensity for interfering equipment
(1) The Minister may from time to time, prescribe limits within which radio
frequency energy produced by interfering equipment of the class or classes
speciﬁed must be suppressed.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this Part of these regulations, no person may
install or use interfering equipment which is contrary to such speciﬁcations as
may be prescribed by the Minister.
(3) Nothing in subclause (2) applies to the installation or use of interfering
equipment by the Minister for the purpose of testing for compliance with the
requirements of these regulations.
(4) It is not a breach of this regulation if, in the opinion of the Minister, harmful
interference suf fered by any receiving apparatus is by reason of its being
incapable of meeting such minimum technical performance as the Minister may
prescribe.
35 Interference with radiocommunications
Despite anything in these regulations, where the Minister is satisﬁed that any
equipment is interfering with reception of radiocommunications transmissions,
the Minister may require the person operating the interfering equipment to cease
operating the equipment or to modify the operation of the equipment to prevent
the interference.
36 Of fences
