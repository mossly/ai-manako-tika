Fines
80 Fines may reﬂect illicit gains
In any case where any person is convicted of a drug dealing of fence and the
court by which that person is convicted is satisﬁed on the balance of
probabilities that any money or assets owned by the of fender at the date of his
or her trial has or have been acquired by him or her directly or indirectly from
the of fence, the court may , having regard to the amount of such money or the
value of such assets, impose a ﬁne greater than it would otherwise have imposed
on the of fender for the of fence.
81 Court may impose greater ﬁne having regard to previous dealings
(1) In any case where any person is convicted of a drug dealing of fence (in this
section referred to as the primary of fence) and the court by which he or she is
convicted is, on the application of the Crown—
(a) satisﬁed beyond reasonable doubt that, before the commission of the
primary of fence, the of fender had engaged in any conduct (other than
conduct that constituted the primary of fence) that constitutes a drug
dealing of fence; and
(b) satisﬁed on the balance of probabilities that any money or assets owned
by the of fender at the date of his or her trial has or have been acquired by
him or her directly or indirectly from such conduct,—
the court may , having regard to the amount of such money or the value of such
assets, impose a ﬁne greater than it would otherwise have imposed on the
of fender for the primary of fence.
(2) Where the prosecutor intends to seek leave to adduce evidence of the matters
referred to in subsection (1), he or she must give written notice of his or her
intention and of the particulars of the evidence to be adduced to the court and to
the defendant as soon as practicable after the conviction is entered, and in any
event not later than 5 days before the date set for sentencing.
(3) Despite anything in subsection (2), where the court is satisﬁed that the
information on which such an application for the exercise of the court’s powers
could be based has come into the prosecutor’s hands too late for him or her to
give 7 days notice as required by that subsection, the court may allow the
prosecutor to give such shorter notice as may be necessary in the circumstances,
but must, if requested to do so by the defendant, postpone sentencing to a date
not earlier than 7 days after the prosecutor gives such notice.
82 Court’s power not to be exercised in certain cases
(1) The power conferred by section 81(1) must not be exercised by any court—
(a) in respect of any conduct in relation to which the defendant has been
charged with a drug dealing of fence but acquitted of that charge:
(b) in respect of any money or assets in relation to which the power has been
previously exercised by any court.
(2) The powers conferred by sections 80 and 81(1) must not be exercised by any
court so as to impose a ﬁne greater than the maximum prescribed by
section 7(2)(b).
83 Inability of of fender to explain source of money or assets may be evidence
(1) Where, in any case to which section 80 applies, the of fender fails to explain to
s 83 NARCOTICS AND MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT 2004
Service 0474,401

the court’s satisfaction the source of any money or assets owned by him, the
court may accept that as evidence that the money or assets was or were derived
by the of fender from the of fence.
(2) Where, on any application for the exercise of the court’s power under
section 81, the court is satisﬁed in accordance with subsection (1)(a) of that
section that the of fender has committed any previous drug dealing of fence, and
the of fender fails to explain to the court’s satisfaction the source of any money
or assets owned by him, the court may accept that as evidence that the money
or assets was or were derived by the of fender from that previous drug dealing
of fence.
84 Court may treat alienated property as of fender’s
Where, in any case to which section 80 or 81 applies, it appears to the court that
any disposition of money or assets has been made, whether for value or not, by
or on behalf of or by direction of or in the interests of the defendant to defeat the
exercise of the court’s power under those sections, the court may , on the
application of the prosecutor or of its own motion, treat the money or assets as
belonging to the of fender for the purposes of those sections.
85 Enforcement of ﬁnes imposed in court
Where the court sentences an of fender on conviction on indictment of a drug
dealing of fence to pay a ﬁne and that ﬁne is not paid within 14 days thereafter,
or within such further time as may be allowed or ﬁxed for the payment thereof,
the following provisions apply—
(a) the Registrar must inquire into the means of the of fender and must—
(i) where, the of fender is detained in a penal institution, issue a
warrant to produce the of fender; or
(ii) issue a summons requiring the of fender, unless he or she sooner
pays the amount outstanding under the conviction, to appear at the
time and place appointed in the summons; or
(iii) if in the opinion of the Registrar a warrant is necessary to compel
the attendance of the defendant, issue a warrant to arrest him or
her and bring him or her before the court to enable the of fender to
be orally examined as to means:
(b) on completion of his or her inquiry , the Registrar must make a report as
to the of fenders means, so far as he or she has been able to ascertain
them, to the Judge who imposed the ﬁne or, if that Judge is unable to act,
any other Judge:
(c) the Judge to whom a report is made under paragraph (b) must consider
the report, and may make such order as he or she thinks ﬁt including an
order—
(i) for the remission of either the whole or part of the ﬁne; or
(ii) for the issue of a writ of sale; or
(iii) for the immediate imprisonment of the of fender; or
(iv) allowing time for payment or allowing payment by instalments:
(d) any money or assets treated as the of fender’s pursuant to section 84 are
deemed to be property of the of fender and amenable as such to any order
of the Judge under paragraph (c).

to the deposit or account of the of fender to deliver that book, receipt, or
document to the court or to disclose its whereabouts to the court, as the case

MEDICAL EXAMINA TIONS:
Y ou will be asked if you wish to undergo certain types of medical examination that may help to
determine whether or not you have any Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs
secreted within your body .
For this reason, a doctor will be asked to see you to explain just what is involved in each type of
examination.
NO SUCH EXAMINA TION MA Y T AKE PLACE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT
If you do wish to undergo an examination, you will be asked to put your consent to the examination
in writing.
If you refuse your consent, you may change your mind later. Just tell 1 of the of f icers supervising

As soon as possible after detaining you, the of f icer must apply to a Judge for a warrant to authorise
your continued detention.
If the Judge grants the warrant, you may be detained for up to 7 days or such shorter period as the
Judge may order. However, a warrant may be renewed by a Judge for further periods of up to 7 days
each, if the judge is satisﬁed that there are still reasonable grounds for believing that you have any
Class A controlled drugs or Class B controlled drugs secreted within your body . Y ou may not be
detained for longer than 21 days.
SUPER VISING LA WYER AND DOCTOR:
If the Judge issues a detention warrant, he or she must appoint a lawyer and a doctor to see that your
rights are protected and that you are properly cared for while you are being detained. These people
are NOT there as part of the team detaining you: they are there as agents of the court to ensure fair
play . Y ou should consult them on any legal or medical matter that is worrying you.
However, you are also entitled to arrange for your own lawyer or doctor to visit and advise you.
