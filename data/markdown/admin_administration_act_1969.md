(1) Where a person who is sole executor of a will is at the date of the testator’s
death a minor who is not entitled to a grant of probate under subsection (3),
administration with the will annexed may be granted to such person as the Court
thinks ﬁt, until the minor becomes entitled to and obtains a grant of probate to
him; and on his attaining full age or sooner becoming entitled to a grant of
probate under that subsection and not before, probate of the will may be granted
to him.
(2) Where a testator by his will appoints a person who at his death is a minor who
is not entitled to a grant of probate under subsection (3) to be an executor, the
appointment shall not operate to transfer any interest in the estate of the
deceased to the minor or to constitute him an administrator for any purpose,
unless and until probate is granted to him under this section.
(3) Where a testator by his will appoints a person who is a minor to be an executor,
probate of the will may be granted to the person if, at the date of the grant,—

(b) the person has attained the age of 18 years and is or has been married.

(a) survives the testator but dies without having been granted probate of the
will; or
(b) is cited to take out probate of the will and does not appear to the citation;
or
(c) renounces probate of the will,—
his rights in respect of the executorship shall wholly cease, and the
representation to the testator and the administration of the testator’s estate shall
devolve and be committed as if that person had not been appointed executor.
(2) Where a person is appointed by a will to be both executor and trustee and his
rights in respect of the executorship wholly cease under subsection (1), his
rights in respect of the trusteeship shall also wholly cease and the trusteeship
shall devolve or be determined as if he had not been appointed as trustee:
Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prevent his subsequent
appointment as trustee.

Service 055,501

before or after the commencement of this Act) to withdraw the renunciation and
prove the will,—

without prejudice to the previous acts and dealings of and notices to any
other person to whom administration has been granted, and a

(b) his rights (if any) in respect of the trusteeship shall revive except so far
as the Court otherwise orders.
Compare: Administration of Estates Act 1925 s 6(UK)
13 Executor of executor represents original testator
(1) An executor of a sole or last surviving executor of a testator shall be the
executor of that testator:
Provided that for the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this subsection a
person who does not prove the will of his testator shall be deemed not to be an
executor notwithstanding his appointment as such by the will, and in the case of
an executor who on his death leaves surviving him some other executor of his
testator who at the time of the testator’s death has not proved but who
afterwards proves the will of that testator, it shall cease to apply when probate
to the surviving executor is granted.
(2) So long as the chain of representation is unbroken, the last executor in the chain
is the executor of every preceding testator.
(3) The chain of representation is broken by—
(a) the failure to leave a will; or
(b) the failure of a testator to appoint an executor; or
(c) the failure to obtain probate of a will,—
but is not broken by a temporary grant of administration if probate is
subsequently granted.
(4) Every person in the chain of representation to a testator—
(a) has the same rights in respect of the estate of that testator as the original
executor would have had if living; and
(b) is, to the extent to which the estate of that testator has come to his hands,
answerable as if he were an original executor.
Compare: Administration of Estates Act 1925 s 7(UK)

Registrar of the Supreme Court to enure for the beneﬁt of the Registrar for the
time being, with 2 sureties approved of by the Court, conditioned for duly
collecting, getting in, and administering the estate of the deceased, which bond
shall be in such form as may be prescribed by rules:
Provided that it shall not be necessary for any trustee corporation or any person
obtaining administration to the use or for the beneﬁt of Her Majesty , to execute
any such bond; and in any case in which the Court is willing to dispense with
sureties under subsection (2) it may if it thinks ﬁt dispense with the bond.
(2) In every case in which a bond is required under subsection (1), the bond shall
be in a penalty equal to the amount under which the estate of the deceased is
sworn, if that amount does not exceed $20,000, and shall be in a penalty of
$20,000 where the amount exceeds that sum; but the Court may in any case
dispense with one or both of the sureties, or direct that the penalty be reduced
in amount, and may also if it thinks ﬁt direct that more bonds than one be given,
so as to limit the liability of any surety to such amount as the Court thinks
reasonable.
(3) The bond required as aforesaid shall relate to both real and personal estate.
(4) The Court may , in any case if it thinks ﬁt, in place of a bond, accept a security
in favour of the Registrar of any corporation or guarantee society approved by
the Governor-General in Council or the security of the State Insurance General
Manager.
(5) Every such security shall be in such form and under such regulations as the rules
direct.
Compare: 1952 No 56 s 6
16 Proceedings if condition of bond broken
The Court may , on being satisﬁed that the condition of any such bond or security
has been broken, order the Registrar to assign the bond or security to some
person to be named in the order; and that person or his administrator may
thereupon sue upon the bond or security in his own name as if the bond or
security had been originally given to him, and shall be entitled to recover
thereon as trustee for all persons interested the full amount recoverable in
respect of any breach of the condition of the bond or security .
Compare: 1952 No 56 s 7
17 Administration as evidence
Every administration of a will or with a will annexed shall be evidence of that
will upon all questions concerning real estate in the same manner and to the
same extent as in questions concerning personal estate; and every administration
shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary , be suf f icient evidence of the death
and the date of the death of the testator or intestate.

18 Certiﬁcates of administration

administrator, issue under his hand and seal such number of certiﬁcates of
administration, in the form set out in Schedule 1, as may be required.
(2) No such certiﬁcate shall be released until the Registrar is satisﬁed, by the
production of the probate or letters of administration or of other satisfactory
evidence, that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has released the probate or
letters of administration under section 43 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968:
Provided that, on request as aforesaid, the Registrar may complete any such
certiﬁcate and send it to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for release by the
Commissioner with the probate or letters of administration.
(3) Every such certiﬁcate shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary , be suf f icient
evidence of the death and the date of death of the testator or intestate and of the
grant of administration to the administrator for all purposes including registering
the administrator as proprietor of any estate or interest in any land under the
Land Transfer Act 1952, or of any mining privilege under the Mining Act 1926,
or of any securities issued by or property in any bank or company or body or
association. No District Land Registrar or Mining Registrar or bank or company
or body or association to which any such certiﬁcate is produced shall be
concerned to inquire concerning the trusts on which the administrator holds any
such land or mining privilege or securities or property , or (except where a caveat
has been lodged under the authority of the Land Transfer Act 1952) as to his
authority to transfer or deal with the same.
(4) The fee payable to the Registrar in respect of each such certiﬁcate shall be $1 or
such other amount as may from time to time be prescribed by the

19 Proceedings where executor neglects to prove will
(1) In any case where any executor named in a will neglects or refuses to prove the
will, or to renounce probate thereof, within 3 months from the death of the
testator, the Court may , upon the application of any other executor or executors
or of any person interested in the estate or of the Public Trustee or of the Maori
Trustee or of any creditor of the testator, grant an order nisi calling upon the
executor who so neglects or refuses to show cause why probate of the will
should not be granted to that executor alone or with any other executor or
executors or, in the alternative, why administration should not be granted to the
applicant or some other person.
(2) Upon proof (whether by af f idavit or otherwise) of service of the order, or upon
the Court dispensing with service of the order, if the executor who is so called
upon does not appear or upon cause being shown, the Court may make such
order for the administration of the estate, and as to costs, as appears just.

through all degrees, according to their stocks, in equal shares if more than
one, the share which their parent would have taken if living at the death
of the intestate, and so that no issue shall take whose parent takes an

21 years from the death of the intestate or who shall sooner attain full age
or marry under that age, that child or those children shall take, in equal
shares if more than one, the share which his, her, or their parent would

interest in any personal chattels to have the use and enjoyment of the
chattels in such manner and subject to such conditions (if any) as the
administrator may consider reasonable, and without being liable to
account for any consequential loss.
(2) If the trusts in favour of the issue of the intestate fail by reason of no child or
other issue attaining an absolutely vested interest—
(a) the estate of the intestate and the income thereof and all statutory
accumulations, if any , of the income thereof, or so much thereof as may
not have been paid or applied under any power af fecting the same, shall
go, devolve, and be held under the provisions of this Act as if the intestate
had died without leaving issue living at the death of the intestate:
(b) references in this Act to the intestate “leaving no issue” shall, subject to
the provisions of this section, be construed as “leaving no issue who
attain an absolutely vested interest”:
(c) references in this Act to the intestate “leaving issue” or “leaving a child
or other issue” shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be
construed as “leaving issue who attain an absolutely vested interest”.

under the will of the deceased, the references in section 77 to a sum of $12,000
payable to a surviving husband or wife, and to interest on that sum, shall be
taken as references to that sum diminished by the value of the said beneﬁcial
interest at the date of death, and to interest on that sum as so diminished, and,
accordingly , where the said value exceeds that sum, section 77 shall have ef fect
as if references to that sum and to interest thereon were omitted.
(3) References in the foregoing provisions of this section to a beneﬁcial interest
acquired under a will shall be construed—
(a) as including a reference to a beneﬁcial interest acquired by virtue of the
exercise by the will of a general power of appointment, but not a special
power of appointment:
(b) as not including a reference to a beneﬁcial interest in any personal
chattels.
(4) For the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this section the administrator
