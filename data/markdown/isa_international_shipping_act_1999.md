Part 2
International shipping policy
3 Shipping policy objectives
(1) For the purposes of this Act, the objectives of the Cook Islands shipping policy
relating to Cook Islands international shipping service are as follows—
(a) to promote, preserve and safeguard fair competition in Cook Islands
international shipping service to the beneﬁt of the public of the Cook
Islands, shippers and carriers, having regard to—
(i) the Cook Islands’ reliance on stable, long term, ef f icient, reliable,
and competitive shipping service, whether provided by individual
carriers or by members of a conference; and
(ii) the need and desirability of maintaining national control of Cook
Islands international shipping service by encouraging the
utilisation of Cook Islands ships in preference to foreign owned
and operated ships:
(b) to safeguard against the abuse of a dominant position by any carrier or
association of carriers and to ensure that any person that has a dominant
position in shipping in the Australasian and/or South Paciﬁc region shall
be precluded, with reference to Cook Islands international shipping
service, from using that dominant position for the purposes of—
(i) restricting the entry of any person or any Cook Islands ship into
that or any other service; or
(ii) preventing or deterring any person or any Cook Islands ship from
engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other service; or
(iii) eliminating any person or Cook Islands ship from that or any other
service:
(c) to discourage and prevent wherever possible, practices by carriers that
have the ef fect of limiting, preventing, or reducing competition among
carriers or which may give rise to any monopoly or cartel in the provision
of Cook Islands international shipping service:
(d) to take whatever steps may be necessary to foster, promote and maintain
the use of Cook Islands ships in respect of Cook Islands international
shipping service:
(e) to encourage carriers to give reasonable notice to shippers who will be
af fected of impending changes to the terms and conditions upon which
the carrier carries goods:
(f) to encourage consultation and negotiation between shippers and carriers
relating to the terms and conditions of the carriage of goods by carriers,
particularly in relation to the following matters—
(i) changes in general tarif f conditions and in the policies on which
such conditions are based:
(ii) changes in the general level of tarif f rates for major commodities:
(iii) promotional freight rates:
(iv) special freight rates:
(v) the imposition of and changes to surcharges:
Service 2211,301

(vi) procedures for the supply of information by shippers in respect of
cargo availability and the nature and volume of cargo to be
shipped:
(vii) the introduction of new technology:
(viii) changes in the pattern of service.
(2) The Minister may , for the purposes of this Act by notice in the Gazette designate
any ship at the time engaged in Cook Islands international shipping service to be
a Cook Islands ship for the purposes of this Act.
(3) No ship may be designated as a Cook Islands ship unless the Minister has ﬁrst
made enquiry of the circumstances of that ship and is satisﬁed, in his or her
reasonable opinion, that the ship is and will remain for so long as it is engaged
in Cook Islands international shipping service, wholly owned, operated, and
controlled, both in law and as a matter of commercial common sense, by a
natural person or persons ordinarily resident in the Cook Islands or by a
company which is wholly owned and controlled by such persons and, further,
that the ship is ﬁnanced by such persons, or if not, that the ef fective risk and
reward of ownership, as a matter of commercial substance, is that of such
persons.
(4) Such designation is deemed to lapse from the date upon which that ship is
withdrawn (other than for repair, maintenance or survey) from Cook Islands
international shipping service.
