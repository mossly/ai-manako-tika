An Act to provide for the leasing of land on Penrhyn and to provide for payment of
adequate compensation in relation thereto.
BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of the Cook Islands in Session assembled, and by
the authority of the same as follows:
WHEREAS by order of the Land Court of the Cook Islands made on 16 August 1976 the
owners of the land NAHARAKURA situated at Omoka on the island of Penhryn were
determined to be the descendants of REV AHUA for that half of the land being the Motu
Koiti or southern portion, and the descendants of P ANGERUA for that half of the land
being the Omoka or northern portion, the court observing that those descendants be
determined in accordance with the provisions of section 446 of the Cook Islands Act
1915.
AND WHEREAS the Cook Islands Government Property Corporation occupies a part of
the land and wishes to occupy further parts, in each case for purposes which are for the
welfare and beneﬁt of the people of the island of Penrhyn.
AND WHEREAS it is desired that valid leases be granted to the Cook Islands
Government Property Corporation.
AND WHEREAS the successors of the said Revahua and Pangerua have not yet been
determined by the High Court of the Cook Islands and it is not practicable to have the
owners of the land grant valid leases to the Cook Islands Government Property
Corporation in the normal way .
AND WHEREAS the Island Council of Penrhyn has sought and ascertained the wishes
of those that it believes to be the owners of the land and has now , on their behalf,
requested the Crown to make special arrangements to enable the Cook Islands
Government Property Corporation to obtain valid leases in respect of the part of the land
occupied by the Corporation, without the need for the High Court of the Cook Islands to
travel to the island of Penrhyn for that purpose.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of the Cook Islands in
Session assembled, and by the authority of the same as follows:
1 Short title
This Act may be cited as the Penrhyn (Naharakura Lease) Facilitation Act 1992.

s 2 PENRHYN (NAHARAKURA LEASE) F ACILIT A TION ACT 1992
Service 07801

the leased lands means, collectively , those parcels of the land which are the
subject of the leases
T rustmeans the Naharakura Development Trust constituted by section 7.
3 V alidation of leases
Each of the leased lands is deemed by operation of this Act to be validly and
ef fectually leased by the owners thereof for themselves, their heirs and
successors to the Cook Islands Government Property Corporation upon and
subject to the terms of the leases.
3A V ariation of lease
Despite any provision contained in this Act or contained or implied in the Dead
of Lease set out in the Schedule, the Queen’s Representative may by order in
Executive Council, if advised by the Minister of Justice that the Minister is
satisﬁed, following consultation by the Minister with the member of Parliament
for the constituency of Penrhyn and the trustees of the Naharakura Development
Trust that it will be in the best interests of the beneﬁciaries of the Trust, amend
or vary the said Deed of Lease by deleting any provision therefrom, adding any
provision thereto, or varying any provision thereof.
[Section 3A: inserted, on 20 March 2009, by section 2 of the Penrhyn (Naharakura Lease)
Facilitation Amendment Act 2009 (2009 No 6).]
4 Preservation of rights of owners
(1) Nothing in this Act shall preclude any owner of the leased lands (determined as
being such by the Land Division of the High Court) from making an application
to the Land Division of the High Court for the purposes of determining the
adequacy of the consideration payable by the Cook Islands Government
Property Corporation in respect of the alienation ef fected by this Act, it being
the wish and intention of the Cook Islands Government Property Corporation to
pay adequate compensation for the leased lands, and in this regard the court
must have regard to the terms and conditions of the leases and also to market
rentals payable on the island of Penrhyn (or if the court is satisﬁed that there are
no such comparable market rentals then in any other of the outer islands) as at
the date of the coming into force of this Act. The court may , upon the making
of any such application, either conﬁrm the adequacy of the compensation or
make any order increasing the compensation payable in such respects as it
thinks ﬁt and proper, having regard to the rights of the owners under Article 40
of the Constitution.
(2) The rights accruing under subsection (1) are deemed to be a cause of action
entitling the applicant to adequate compensation in accordance with Article 40
of the Constitution and such cause is deemed to have accrued as at the date of
the coming into force of this Act and is accordingly subject to the provisions of
section 4(1)(d) of the Limitation Act 1950 of New Zealand as applied in the
Cook Islands.
(3) Any determination made by the court pursuant to subsection (1) is (subject to
the usual rights of appeal) binding on all other landowners and the court must,
in determining appropriate steps to be taken in the proceedings by way of
service and notice, have regard to the provisions of this section and to the
consequences of those provisions.

5 Powers of High Court unaf fected
Nothing in this Act af fects the jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of the
land, or the remaining land, to determine the descendants of Revahua and
Pangerua or to determine the relative interests to which each such successor is
entitled in each of the leased lands.
6 Application of proceeds of leasing
(1) The proceeds of leasing of each of the leased lands must be paid and dealt with
in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the provisions of the Cook
Islands Act 1915 have no application in this respect.
(2) The proceeds of leasing of each of the leased lands must be paid to the
Naharakura Development Trust.
7 Naharakura Development T rust constituted
(1) There is hereby constituted a body corporate to be known as the Naharakura
Development Trust, the trustees of which are the members from time to time of
the Island Council of Penrhyn.
(2) The beneﬁciaries of the trust are the successors of Revahua and Pangerua.
(3) The Island Council is authorised to apply both the capital and the income of the
trust for the beneﬁt of the beneﬁciaries of the trust as the trustees in their sole
discretion think ﬁt. The application of the capital and income of the trust for
such charitable purposes beneﬁcial to the people of the island of Penrhyn (and
whether on the island of Penrhyn or elsewhere) as the Island Council thinks ﬁt
is deemed to be a proper application of the capital and income of the trust for the
beneﬁt of the beneﬁciaries in any case where the trustees, acting in good faith,
are satisﬁed that the capital and/or income so applied is for the beneﬁt (in whole
or in part) of the descendants of Revahua and Pangerua.
(4) Any person who has been determined by the Land Division of the High Court
to be an owner in the leased lands and who has had his or her relative interest
in each of the leased lands determined by the court may—
(a) by notice in writing to the trust assign all his or her rights and interests in
the capital and income of the trust to the trustees to hold on trust for
charitable purposes beneﬁcial to the people of the island of Penrhyn
(wherever resident); or
(b) require the trust to account to him or her for his or her share of the
proceeds of leasing of each of the leased lands.
(5) Any person who, in accordance with subsection (4) assigns and sets over his or
her rights and interests in the capital and income of the trust must be noted by
the trustees as having made a donation for charitable purposes to the trust and
the trustees must cause, if that person so wishes, details of that donation to be
published on the island of Penrhyn, and must thereafter hold those rights and
interests on trust for charitable purposes beneﬁcial to the people of the island of
Penrhyn (wherever resident).
(6) Any person who requires the trust to account to him or her for their share of the
proceeds of leasing of each of the leased lands shall receive from the trust such
sum as the trust calculates as being due and owing to that person, after
deducting therefrom an amount calculated by reference to the use and
enjoyment (past and prospective) by that person and his or her dependants of the
assets to which the capital and income have been invested. Any person
s 7 PENRHYN (NAHARAKURA LEASE) F ACILIT A TION ACT 1992
Service 07803

dissatisﬁed with the determination of the Island Council in this regard has a
right of appeal to the High Court which may , on appeal, conﬁrm, increase or
reduce the determination.
