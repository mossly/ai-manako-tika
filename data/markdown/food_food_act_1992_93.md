Export of seafood
[Part 7A: inserted, on 10 October 2005, by section 6 of the Food Amendment Act 2005 (2005
No 13).]
34A Purpose and scope of Part 7A
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, it is within the purpose and
scope of this Act, for the Minister of Health to implement a special regime
relating to the administration, management, monitoring, and auditing of the
export of seafood by means of—
(a) introducing individual risk management programmes generally requiring
all persons preparing ﬁsh export product or owning, occupying, or having
charge or control of any ﬁsh premises, to operate under registered and
independently veriﬁed risk management programmes, unless and to the
extent that such a programme is deemed unnecessary by reason of—
(i) the negligible degree of risk associated with the relevant ﬁsh
export product, operations, or intended ﬁsh export product use; or
(ii) the fact that the ﬁsh export product and operations concerned are
covered by another legislative regime.
(b) providing for other persons involved with ﬁsh export product to operate
under risk management programmes where the risk factors involved, or
the requirements of overseas markets, justify such a requirement:
(c) implementing regulated control schemes in the case of ﬁsh export
product for which individually tailored risk management programmes are
impracticable or inappropriate. These schemes may be an alternative or a
supplement to individual risk management programmes:
(d) establishing ﬁsh export product standards that set criteria that must be
met for ﬁsh export products to be treated as ﬁt for their intended purpose
(whether or not those products are also produced under an individual risk
management programme or a regulated control scheme), and for the
setting of any technical speciﬁcations required to meet those standards:
(e) implementing provisions in relation to export of ﬁsh export product from
the Cook Islands or of Cook Islands origin, by—
(i) requiring the registration of all exporters of ﬁsh export product,
(subject to any speciﬁed exemptions); and
(ii) where appropriate in the light of market access requirements of
foreign governments, specifying for certain ﬁsh export products
requirements which may be additional to the normal Cook Islands
requirements; and
(iii) providing for the giving to foreign governments of of f icial
assurances in relation to ﬁsh export product exported from the
Cook Islands or of Cook Islands origin:
(f) establishing standards and speciﬁcations relating to the monitoring and
auditing of compliance with the matters set out in this section:
(g) providing for the delegation in respect of any special regime of the
functions and powers of the Minister of Health, the Board or authorised
of f icers to recognised agencies and accredited persons:
(h) addressing non-compliance.
