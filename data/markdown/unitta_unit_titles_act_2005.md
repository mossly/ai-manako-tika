Upon the conﬁrmation of a unit plan the provisions of this Part shall subject to
section 1(3) apply .
23 Preservation of lessor’s interest

a unit plan is or is deemed to be a severance of the lessor’s reversionary estate

estate in the land in all respects as if the unit plan had not been conﬁrmed.

25 Dealing with stratum estate in leasehold
(1) The lessor’s consent is required to any assignment of a stratum estate in
leasehold, provided that such consent must not be unreasonably or arbitrarily
withheld, but this proviso does not preclude the right of the lessor to require

in connection with any such consent.

inconsistent in any way with those of any instrument of alienation of or af fecting
that stratum estate in leasehold then despite the giving of consent to that
assignment by the lessor—
(a) the provisions of that instrument of alienation prevail over those of the
assignment; and
(b) the provisions of the assignment are deemed consequentially amended to
the extent required to resolve the inconsistency; and
Service 0636,301

in leasehold being assigned is situated and assignment includes a transfer,
assignment, underletting or parting with possession of the whole or any part of

including the transfer, assignment underletting or parting with possession of any
lesser interest therein.
(8) If the proprietor of a stratum estate in leasehold being assigned is a
unincorporated body of persons or is a company or other body corporate, then
any disposal of any ownership interest or shares in that proprietor is deemed to
be an assignment and the provisions of subsections (5), (6), and (7) apply
mutatis mutandis to that assignment.

to what period of time is reasonable for the purposes of remedying any breach
and failing such agreement, what constitutes “reasonable” in the circumstances

requisite proxies.
19 Save as otherwise provided in these rules, no business shall be transacted at any general
meeting of the Body Corporate unless a quorum is present at the time.
20 If within half an hour from the time appointed for a general meeting of the Body Corporate

exercise if it were an individual person.
24 At any meeting of the Body Corporate any person present and entitled to vote on the
matter that is under consideration may demand a poll thereon, which shall be taken in such
manner as the chairman thinks ﬁt.

personally or by proxy . Where 2 or more persons are jointly entitled to exercise one vote
and wish to do so by proxy , that proxy shall be jointly appointed by them and may be one
of them. A proxy shall be appointed in writing. If only one of those persons is present at
a general meeting and they have not appointed a proxy as aforesaid, he or she may
exercise the vote.
27 Where a poll is demanded or a special resolution is before the meeting, each vote shall
correspond in value with the unit entitlement of the principal unit and accessory unit (if
any) in respect of which it is exercised. In all other cases each vote shall be of equal
value.
28 In the event of there being an equal number of votes for and against any matter, then such
matter in dif ference shall be referred to a single arbitrator in case the Proprietors can agree
on one who may be the Body Corporate’s secretary if they are not a Proprietor, and
otherwise to two arbitrators one to be appointed by each group of Proprietors to the matter
in dif ference, and in the event of such arbitrators being unable to agree then to their umpire
to be appointed by them before entering upon the consideration of the matter submitted to
them and in either case in all respects with the provisions on that behalf contained in the
Arbitration Act 1908 or any statutory modiﬁcation or re-enactment thereof for the time
being in force and the decision of such arbitrator, arbitrators or their umpire shall be ﬁnal
and binding upon all Proprietors and upon the Body Corporate.
29 Except where a unanimous resolution is required, a power of voting in respect of a unit
shall not be exercised unless all amounts accrued due and payable under the Unit Titles
Act 2005 to the Body Corporate in respect of the Unit in respect of which the vote is
exercisable have been duly paid.
30 If there is no committee, the responsibility for the matters set out in clause 12 of these
rules except paragraph (a) and the powers given to the committee by clause 11 of these
rules except paragraph (a), shall be those of the Body Corporate; and unless the context
otherwise requires, every reference in these rules to the committee shall be read as a
reference to the Body Corporate.

such conditions as it may approve; and any secretary so appointed may be removed by the
Body Corporate, either at a subsequent annual general meeting or at an extraordinary
general meeting called for that purpose. At any such meeting the secretary shall have the

34 For the purposes of these rules a special resolution means a resolution proposed at a
general meeting of the Body Corporate of which at least 14 days notice specifying the
intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given.
35 Where a resolution is proposed as a special resolution the vote of the meeting shall be
taken in the same way as if it had been proposed as an ordinary resolution and a poll had
been demanded provided that a special resolution shall be deemed not to be carried unless
persons entitled to exercise not less that three-fourths of the number of votes exercisable
in respect of all the units vote in favour of it.

appointed by the Body Corporate may in the name of and on behalf of the Body Corporate

Proprietors sign one or other of such separate documents.
38 Where in the opinion of the Body Corporate it is necessary to undertake any work which
is substantially for the beneﬁt of one unit only or is substantially for the beneﬁt of one or
more units then the Body Corporate may apportion the amount payable to the Proprietor
or Proprietors of those units notwithstanding that the amount so apportioned may be
dif ferent from the unit entitlement apportionment, without the necessity to make an

meeting of the Body Corporate unless a quorum is present at the time.

correspond in value with the unit entitlement of the principal unit and accessory unit (if
any) in respect of which it is exercised. In all other cases each vote shall be of equal
value.

them and in either case in all respects with the provisions on that behalf contained in the
Arbitration Act 1908 or any statutory modiﬁcation or re-enactment thereof for the time
being in force and the decision of such arbitrator, arbitrators or their umpire shall be ﬁnal

been demanded provided that a special resolution shall be deemed not to be carried unless
persons entitled to exercise not less that three-fourths of the number of votes exercisable
in respect of all the units vote in favour of it.

Proprietors sign one or other of such separate documents.

is substantially for the beneﬁt of one unit only or is substantially for the beneﬁt of one or
more units then the Body Corporate may apportion the amount payable to the Proprietor
or Proprietors of those units notwithstanding that the amount so apportioned may be
