Goals of the Church
6 Goals of the Church
It shall be the sacred duty of the Church to seek for the attainment and fulﬁlment
of God’s Will through the following goals—
(a) T o Preach Salvation
It is the work of the Church to preach the gospel to every creature and
to expound the plan of salvation as taught in the Scriptures. Christ has
made salvation possible by providing it, the Church must make it actual
by proclaiming it.
(b) T o Provide a Means of W orship
The Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour and Mediator founded the Church,
a Divine institution, to continue His work on earth, an institution that
possessed a divinely established system by which the congregation
approached God in all the needs and crises of life. The Church likewise
must be a house of prayer for all manner of people where God is
honoured in worship, prayer and testimony .
(c) T o Provide Religious Fellowship
Man is a social being; he craves fellowship and an exchange of
friendship. He naturally assembles with those who share common
interests. The Church provides a fellowship based on the Fatherhood of
God, and the Lordship of Christ. It is a brotherhood or sisterhood of those
who share a common spiritual experience.
In this world one of the strongest drawing features of the Church is the
warmth and solidarity of fellowship — a fellowship where all earthly
distinctions are obliterated and where men and women become brothers
and sisters in Christ.
(d) T o Hold up the Moral Standard
The Church is the “light of the world”, to banish moral ignorance; it is
the “salt of the earth”, to preserve it from moral corruption. The Church
must teach men how to live as well as to die. It must hold forth God’s
plan for the regulation of all spheres of life and activity . Against the
downward trends of society it must lift a warning voice; at all danger
points it must plant a beacon light.
(e) Promotion of Aims and Objectives of Organisations
Art cl 6 COOK ISLANDS CHRISTIAN CHURCH INCORP ACT 1968–69
