5 Rules for determining existence of partnership
In determining whether a partnership does or does not exist regard shall be had
to the following rules:

not of itself create a partnership as to anything so held or owned, whether
the tenants or owners do or do not share any proﬁts made by the use
thereof:
(b) the sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership,
s 5 P AR TNERSHIP ACT 1908
Service 0785,301

whether the persons sharing such returns have or have not a joint or
common right or interest in any property from which or from the use of
which the returns are derived:
(c) the receipt by a person of a share of the proﬁts of a business is prima
facie evidence that he is a partner in the business, but the receipt of such
a share or of a payment contingent on or varying with the proﬁts of a
business does not of itself make him a partner in the business and, in
particular,—
(i) the receipt by a person of a debt or other liquidated amount, by
instalments or otherwise, out of the accruing proﬁts of a business
does not of itself make him a partner in the business or liable as
such:
(ii) a contract for the remuneration of a servant or agent of a person
engaged in a business by a share of the proﬁts of the business does
not of itself make the servant or agent a partner in the business or
liable as such:
(iii) a person being the widow or child of a deceased partner, and
receiving by way of annuity a portion of the proﬁts made in the
business in the deceased person was a partner, is not by reason
only of such receipt a partner in the business or liable as such:
(iv) the advance of money by way of loan to a person engaged or
about to engage in any business on a contract with that person that
the lender shall receive a rate of interest varying with the proﬁts,
or shall receive a share of the proﬁts arising from carrying on the
business, does not of itself make the lender a partner with the
person or persons carrying on the business, or liable as such:
Provided that the contract is in writing, and signed by or on behalf
of all the parties thereto:
(v) a person receiving by way of annuity or otherwise a portion of the
proﬁts of a business in consideration of the sale by him of the
goodwill of the business is not, by reason only of such receipt, a
partner in the business or liable as such.

buyer of a goodwill in consideration of a share of the proﬁts of the business,
being adjudged a bankrupt, entering into an arrangement to pay his creditors less
than 100 cents in the dollar, or dying in insolvent circumstance, the lender of the
loan shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of his loan, and the seller
of the goodwill shall not be entitled to recover anything in respect of the share
of proﬁts contracted for, until the claims of the other creditors of the borrower
