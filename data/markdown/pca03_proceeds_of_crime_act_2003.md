commission of a serious of fence, the person’s advantage is taken to be a sum of
money equal to the value of the advantage so derived.

beneﬁted from the commission of a serious of fence, or from that of fence taken
together with other serious of fences, shall deem—
(a) all property appearing to the Court to be:
(i) held by the person on the day when application is made; and

Service 0362,301

(d) if evidence is given at the hearing of the application that the value of the
person’s property increased after committing an of fence, the increase is
