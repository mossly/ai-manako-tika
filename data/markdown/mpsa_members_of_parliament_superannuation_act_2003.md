the Clerk is satisﬁed that the member does not wish to exercise the option
af forded him under this section, either by reason of the expiry of the 25 day
period referred to in this section, or by that member, prior to the expiry of that
period advising the Clerk, in writing, of his intention not to exercise that option.

manner contemplated by the Superannuation Act. In any other case, the Clerk,
for the Legislative Service, must retain the contributions of the Legislative
Service and disburse to that member those contributions of that member
previously deducted.
