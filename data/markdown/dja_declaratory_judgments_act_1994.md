An Act to enable the High Court to give declaratory judgments or orders.
BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of the Cook Islands in Session assembled, and by
the authority of the same as follows:
1 Short title
This Act may be cited as the Declaratory Judgments Act 1994.
2 Declaratory judgments
No action or proceeding in the High Court is open to objection on the ground
that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby , and the said court
may make binding declarations of right, whether any consequential relief is or
could be claimed or not.
3 Declaratory orders on originating summons
(1) Where any person—
(a) has done or desires to do any act, the validity , legality , or ef fect of which
depends on the construction or validity of any enactment, or any deed,
will, or document of title, or any agreement made or evidenced by
writing, or any memorandum or articles of association of any company or
body corporate, or any instrument prescribing the powers of any
company or body corporate; or
(b) claims to have acquired any right under any such enactment, deed, will,
document of title, agreement, memorandum, articles, or instrument, or to
be in any other manner interested in the construction or validity
thereof,—
such person may apply to the High Court by originating summons for a
declaratory order determining any enactment, deed, will, document of title,
agreement, memorandum, articles of instrument, or of any part thereof.
(2) For the purposes of this section, enactment has the same meaning as in Article
1 of the Constitution.
[Section 3(1): amended, on 19 June 2006, by section 2 of the Declaratory Judgments Amendment
Act 2006 (2006 No 1).]
4 Ef fect of declaratory orders
Any declaration so made on any such originating summons has the same ef fect
as the like declaration in a judgment in an action, and is binding on the person
making the application and on all persons on whom the summons has been
served, and on all other persons who would have been bound by the said
declaration if the proceedings wherein the declaration is made had been an
action.
5 Service of originating summons
The High Court or a Judge thereof may direct that any such originating
summons be served on such persons as the said court or Judge thinks ﬁt, and
such direction may be given at the time when the summons is issued or
subsequently .
6 Summons to be subject to rules of court
Subject to the provisions of this Act and to any rules of court hereafter made in
accordance with the Judicature Act 1980–81, any such originating summons is
s 6 DECLARA TORY JUDGMENTS ACT 1994
Service 0110,301

subject to the rules of court which are for the time being in force with respect
of an originating summons taken out by trustees for the interpretation of a deed
or instrument creating a trust.
7 Removal of summons into Court of Appeal
Any such originating summons may be removed into the Court of Appeal in the
same manner as the matters speciﬁed in sections 52 and 53 of the Judicature
Act 1980–81 are removable, and the provisions of sections 52 and 53 of that Act
apply to any originating summons so removed accordingly .
8 Appeal to Court of Appeal
An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from any judgement or order given or
made in pursuance of this Act, in the same manner as in the case of a ﬁnal
judgment of the High Court.
9 Judgment or order in anticipation of any act or event
Any declaratory judgment or order given or made in pursuance of this Act may
be given or made by way of anticipation with respect to any act not yet done or
any event which has not yet happened, and in such case the said judgment or
order has the same binding ef fect with respect to that future act or event, and the
rights or liabilities to arise therefrom, as if that act or event had already been
done or had already happened before the said judgment or order was given or
made.
10 Jurisdiction discretionary
The jurisdiction hereby conferred upon the High Court to give or make a
declaratory judgment or order is discretionary , and the said Court may , on any
grounds which it deems suf f icient, refuse to give or make any such judgment or
order.
11 Declaratory judgments or orders in cases where cannot give relief
The jurisdiction hereby conferred upon the High Court to give or make any
declaratory judgment or order is not excluded by the fact that the High Court has
no power to give relief in the matter to which the judgment or order relates, or
that such matter would, independently of this Act, be within the exclusive
jurisdiction of any other court.
12 Decisions of Court of Appeal to bind all other courts
Subject to any decision of the Privy Council, any decision of the Court of
Appeal under this Act is binding as a precedent in all other courts in the Cook
Islands.
13 Costs
The costs of any action, summons, or appeal under this Act are in the discretion
of the court, and the court may in the exercise of that discretion order the whole
or any part of those costs to be paid by any party , although successful in the
action, summons, or appeal, and may in any case direct that costs awarded to
any party be taxed either as between party and party or as between solicitor and
party .
