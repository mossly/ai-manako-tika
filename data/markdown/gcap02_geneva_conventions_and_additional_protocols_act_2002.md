of fence has been in custody in connection with that of fence, while awaiting trial,
in a place other than a camp or place in which protected prisoners of war are
detained, for an aggregate period of not less than 3 months, the Court may direct
that the prisoner be transferred from that custody to the custody of an of f icer of
the Cook Islands police and thereafter remain in police custody at a camp or
place in which protected prisoners of war are detained, and be brought before
the Court at the time appointed for that prisoner’s trial.
