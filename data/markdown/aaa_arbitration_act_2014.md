(2) Failing such determination,—
(a) in the case of international arbitration, the number of arbitrators shall be
3:

11 Appointment of arbitrators

as an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
(2) The parties are free to agree on a procedure of appointing the arbitrator or
arbitrators, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5).

arbitrator; if a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days of

(2) An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to
justiﬁable doubts as to that arbitrator’s impartiality or independence, or if that
arbitrator does not possess qualiﬁcations agreed to by the parties. A party may
challenge an arbitrator appointed by that party , or in whose appointment that
party has participated, only for reasons of which that party becomes aware after

challenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the challenge.
(3) If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the
procedure of paragraph (2) is not successful, the challenging party may request,
within 30 days after having received notice of the decision rejecting the
challenge, the High Court to decide on the challenge, which decision shall be
subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal,
including the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings and
make an award.
(4) Nothing in this article shall authorise the use of the challenge procedure in
respect of alleged impartiality or lack of independence arising out of or in
relation to the actual conduct of the arbitration. Such matters may be raised only
in an application under article 34 to set aside the subsequent award.
14 Failure or impossibility to act
(1) If an arbitrator becomes de jure or de facto (in law or in fact) unable to perform
the functions of that of f ice or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay ,
that arbitrator’s mandate terminates on withdrawal from of f ice or, if the parties
agree, on the termination. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of
those grounds, any party may request the High Court to decide on the
termination of the mandate, which decision shall be subject to no appeal.
(2) If, under this article or article 13(2), an arbitrator withdraws from of f ice or a
party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, this does not
imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this article or
article 12(2).
15 Appointment of substitute arbitrator
(1) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates under article 13 or 14, or because
of withdrawal from of f ice for any other reason, or because of the revocation of
that arbitrator’s mandate by agreement of the parties, or in any other case of
Sch 1 ARBITRA TION ACT 2014
Service 0340,805

termination of that mandate, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according
to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being
replaced.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,—
(a) where the sole or the presiding arbitrator is replaced, any hearings
previously held shall be repeated; and
(b) where an arbitrator, other than a sole or a presiding arbitrator is replaced,
any hearings previously held may be repeated at the discretion of the
arbitral tribunal.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal
made prior to the replacement of an arbitrator under this article is not invalid
solely because there has been a change in the composition of the arbitral
tribunal.

Chapter 4 — Jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal
16 Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction
(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections
with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that
purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as
an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the
arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure
(necessarily) the invalidity of the arbitration clause.
(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not
later than the submission of the statement of defence. A party is not precluded
from raising such a plea by the fact that that party has appointed, or participated
in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding
the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be
beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The
arbitral tribunal may , in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay
justiﬁed.
(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) either as a
preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules
on such a plea as a preliminary question, any party may request, within 30 days
after having received notice of that ruling, the High Court to decide the matter,
which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending,
the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.

the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties
have subjected it, or, failing any indication on that question, under
