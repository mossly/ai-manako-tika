operation, concept, principle, discovery , or data expressed, described, explained,
illustrated, or otherwise embodied in the work.

if the copies are ﬁxed as tangible objects and have not already been

book, but no rights relating to any subsequent distributions occurring, for
example, by their resale in a second-hand bookstore):
(f) adapting, arranging, translating, transforming, or modifying the work in

(a) is not the owner of the copyright; and
(b) does not have the permission of the owner of the copyright to act in that
way (for example, a licence or other contractual arrangement); and
(c) is acting other than in a way permitted under any of sections 14 to 25 (the
exceptions).

more copies of a published work in accordance with the provisions of any
enactment currently in force in the Cook Islands that requires a copy of the work
to be deposited with a library or other cultural institution for the purposes of
preserving the Cook Island’s documentary heritage.

of the work is the original owner of the copyright in the work.

original owner of the copyright in the work.
(6) If the work is a ﬁlm, the producer of the ﬁlm is the original owner of the
copyright, unless a contract provides otherwise. However, an author of the ﬁlm,
or of a work included in or adapted for the ﬁlm, remains the original owner of
the copyright of that work to the extent that copyright exists in the work
independently of the ﬁlm.
11 T ransmission and licensing of copyright
(1) The copyright in a work—

copyright; or
s 8LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 360,502

(6) T o avoid doubt, an assignment in whole or in part of the copyright in a work, or
a licence to do an act in respect of the copyright in a work, does not include, and
must not be treated for any purpose as including, the assignment or licence of
any economic right not expressly speciﬁed in the assignment or licensing
agreement.
