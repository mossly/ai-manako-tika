An Act to ef fect reforms in the law relating to (1) the ef fect of death in relation to causes
of action; (2) proceedings against, and contributions between, tortfeasors; (3) damages
from injury resulting from shock and (4) liability in the case of contributory negligence.
BE IT ENACTED by the Legislative Assembly of the Cook Islands in Session
assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:
1 Short title and division into parts
(1) This Act may be cited as the Law Reform Act 1968.
(2) This Act is divided into Parts, as follows:
Part 1 — Survival of causes of action after death (section 2)
Part 2 — Liability of tortfeasors (sections 3 and 4)
Part 3 — Damages for injury resulting from shock (section 5)
Part 4 — Contributory negligence (sections 6 to 8)
Part 5 — Act to bind the Crown (section 9)
Part 1
Survival of causes of action after death
2 Ef fect of death on certain causes of action
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part, on the death of any person after the
coming into force of this Act all causes of action subsisting against or vested in
him or her survive against or, as the case may be, for the beneﬁt of his or her
estate:
Provide that this subsection does not apply to causes of action for defamation or
seduction or for inducing one spouse to leave or remain apart from the other or
to claims for damages on the ground of adultery .
(2) Where a cause of action survives as aforesaid for the beneﬁt of the estate of a
deceased person, the damages recoverable for the beneﬁt of the estate of that
person—
(a) do not include any exemplary damages, any damages for his or her pain
or suf fering, or for any bodily or mental harm suf fered by him, or for the
curtailment of his or her expectation of life:
(b) in the case of a breach of promise to marry is limited to such damage (if
any) to the estate of that person as ﬂows from the breach of promise to
marry:
(c) where the death of that person has been caused by the act or omission
which gives rise to the cause of action, must be calculated without
reference to any loss or gain to his or her estate consequent on his or her
death, except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be included.
(3) No proceedings shall be maintainable in respect of a cause of action in tort
which by virtue of this Part has survived against the estate of a deceased person,
unless either—
(a) proceedings against him or her in respect of that cause of action were
pending at the date of his or her death; or
(b) the cause of action arose not earlier than 2 years before his or her death
and proceedings are taken in respect thereof not later than 12 months
after his or her personal representative took out representation:
s 2 LA W REFORM ACT 1968
Service 035,301

Provided that no such proceedings shall be maintainable unless notice in writing
giving reasonable information of the circumstances upon which the proceedings
will be based and the name and address of the prospective plaintif f and of his or
her solicitor or agent (if any) in the matter is given by the prospective plaintif f
to the personal representative of the deceased person as soon as practicable after
the personal representative took out representation.
(4) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (3), application may be made to the
Court, after notice to the personal representative, for leave to bring the
proceeding at any time before the expiration of 6 years after the date when the
cause of action arose, whether or not notice has been given to the personal
representative under subsection (3); and the Court may , if it thinks it is just to
do so, grant leave accordingly , subject to such conditions (if any) as it thinks it
is just to impose, where it considers that the failure to give the notice or the
delay in bringing the proceedings, as the case may be, was occasioned by
mistake or by any other reasonable cause or that the personal representative was
not materially prejudiced in his or her defence or otherwise by the failure or
delay . No distribution of any part of the estate of the deceased made before the
date of the giving of the notice may be disturbed by reason of the application or
of an order made thereon.
(5) Where damage has been suf fered by reason of any act or omission in respect of
which a cause of action would have subsisted against any person if that person
had not died before or at the same time as the damage was suf fered, there is
deemed, for the purposes of this Part, to have been subsisting against the person
before their death such cause of action in respect of that act or omission as
would have subsisted if the person had died after the damage was suf fered.
(6) The rights conferred by this Part for the beneﬁt of estates of deceased persons
are in addition to and not in derogation of any rights conferred by the Deaths by
Accidents Compensation Act 1952 of the Parliament of New Zealand, and so
much of this Part as relates to causes of action against the estates of deceased
persons applies in relation to causes of action under that Act.
(7) In the event of the insolvency of an estate against which proceedings are
maintainable by virtue of this section, any liability in respect of the cause of
action in respect of which the proceedings are maintainable is deemed to be a
debt provable in the administration of the estate notwithstanding that it is a
demand in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by a
contract, promise, or breach of trust.

Part 2
Liability of tortfeasors
3 Proceedings against, and contribution between, joint and several
tortfeasors
(1) Where damage is suf fered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime
or not)—
(a) judgment recovered against any tortfeasor liable in respect of that
damage is not a bar to an action against any other person who would, if
sued, have been liable as a joint tortfeasor in respect of the same damage:
(b) if more than one action is brought in respect of that damage by or on
behalf of the person by whom it was suf fered, or for the beneﬁt of the
estate, or of the wife, husband, parent, or child of that person, against
tortfeasors liable in respect of the damage (whether as joint tortfeasors or
otherwise), the sums recoverable under the judgments given in those
actions by way of damages must not in the aggregate exceed the amount
of the damages awarded by the judgment ﬁrst given; and in any of those
actions, other than that in which the judgment is ﬁrst given the plaintif f is
not entitled to costs unless the Court is of opinion that there was
reasonable ground for bringing the action:
(c) any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution
from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued in time have been,
liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or
otherwise, so, however, that no person is entitled to recover contribution
under this section from any person entitled to be indemniﬁed by him or
her in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is
sought.
(2) A tortfeasor may recover contribution under this section from the husband or
wife or the former husband or wife of the person by whom the damage was
suf fered in any case where he could have recovered such contribution if the
marriage relationship had never existed.
(3) In any proceedings for contributions under this section the amount of the
contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the
Court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s
responsibility for the damage; and the Court shall have power to exempt any
person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be
recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity .
(4) For the purposes of this section—
(a) the expressions parent and child have the same meanings as they have
for the purposes of the Deaths by Accidents Compensation Act 1952 of
the Parliament of New Zealand:
(b) the reference in this section to the judgment ﬁrst given must, in a case
where that judgment is reversed on appeal, be construed as a reference to
the judgment ﬁrst given which is not so reversed, and in a case where a
judgment is varied on appeal, be construed as a reference to that
judgment as so varied.
(5) Nothing in this section—
Service 037,301

(a) af fects any criminal proceedings against any person in respect of any
wrongful act; or
(b) renders enforceable any agreement for indemnity which would not have
been enforceable if this section had not been passed.
4 Repeal
Section 643 of the Cook Islands Act 1915 is hereby repealed.

Part 3
Damages for injury resulting from shock
5 Damages may be recovered for injury suf fered as a result of shock
In any action for injury to the person, whether founded in contract or in tort or
otherwise, a party is not debarred from recovering damages merely because the
injury complained of arose wholly or in part from mental or nervous shock.

Part 4
Contributory negligence
6 Interpretation
In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,—
Court, in relation to any claim, means the Court or arbitrator by or before whom
the claim falls to be determined
damage includes loss of life and personal injury
dependant means any person for whose beneﬁt an action could be brought
under the Deaths by Accidents Compensation Act 1952 of the New Zealand
Parliament
employer and worker have the same meaning as in The Cook Islands W orkers’
Compensation Ordinance 1964
fault means negligence, breach of statutory duty , or other act or omission which
gives rise to a liability in tort or would, apart from this Part, give rise to the
defence of contributory negligence.
7 Apportionment of liability in case of contributory negligence
(1) Where any person suf fers damage as the result partly of his or her own fault and
partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that
damage is not defeated by reason of the fault of the person suf fering the damage,
but the damages recoverable in respect thereof must be reduced to such extent
as the Court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in
the responsibility for the damage:
Provided that—
(a) this subsection does not operate to defeat any defence arising under a
contract:
(b) where any contract or enactment providing for the limitation of liability
is applicable to the claim, the amount of damages recoverable by the
claimant by virtue of this subsection must not exceed the maximum limit
so applicable.
(2) Where damages are recoverable by any person by virtue of subsection (1)
subject to such reduction as is therein mentioned, the Court must ﬁnd and record
the total damages which would have been recoverable if the claimant had not
been at fault.
(3) Section 3 applies in any case where two or more persons are liable or would, if
they had all been sued, be liable by virtue of subsection (1) in respect of the
damage suf fered by any person.
(4) Where any person dies as the result partly of his or her own fault and partly of
the fault of any other person or persons, and accordingly if an action were
brought for the beneﬁt of the estate under section 2 the damages recoverable
would be reduced under subsection (1), any damages recoverable in an action
brought for the beneﬁt of the dependants of that person under the Deaths by
Accidents Compensation Act 1952 of the Parliament of New Zealand must be
reduced to a proportionate extent.
Service 041,301

(5) Where, in any case to which subsection (1) applies, one of the persons at fault
avoids liability to any other such person or his or her personal representative by
pleading any enactment limiting the time within which proceedings may be
taken, the person is not entitled to recover any damages or contributions from
that other person or representative by virtue of that subsection.
8 Provision as to workers and employers
(1) Where, within the time limit for the taking of proceedings under the Cook
Islands W orkers’ Compensation Ordinance 1964, an action is brought to recover
damages independently of that Ordinance in respect of an injury or disease
giving rise to a claim for compensation under that Ordinance, and it is
determined in that action that—
(a) damages are recoverable independently of that Ordinance subject to such
reduction as is mentioned in section 7(1); and
(b) the employer would have been liable to pay compensation under the
Cook Islands W orkers’ Compensation Ordinance 1964,—
section 23 of the Cook Islands W orkers’ Compensation Ordinance 1964 (which
enables the Court, on the dismissal of an action to recover damages
independently of that Ordinance, to assess compensation under that Ordinance)
applies in all respects as if the action had been dismissed, and, if the claimant
chooses to have compensation assessed in accordance with the said section 23,
no damages are recoverable in the action.
(2) Where a worker or his or her personal representative or dependant has recovered
compensation under The Cook Islands W orkers’ Compensation Ordinance 1964
in respect of an injury caused under circumstances which would give a right to
recover reduced damages in respect thereof by virtue of section 7 from some
person other than the employer (hereinafter referred to as the third party), any
right conferred by section 27 of the Cook Islands W orkers’ Compensation
Ordinance 1964 on the person by whom the compensation was paid to be
indemniﬁed by the third party is limited to a right to be indemniﬁed in respect
of such part only of the sum paid or payable by the said person as bears to the
total sum so paid or payable the same proportion as the said reduced damages
bear to the total damages which would have been recoverable if the worker had
not been at fault.
