Innkeepers’ liability

(1) The provisions of sections 2 and 4 to 9 have ef fect, in place of the rules of the
common law and of the provisions of any previous enactment to deﬁne an
innkeeper and to regulate his or her liability as an innkeeper for the loss of or
damage to property brought to the inn by guests, and to deﬁne the persons to
whom he or she is so liable.
(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), it is hereby declared that
nothing in section 86 of the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 of the
Parliament of Great Britain may be construed to af fect in any way the liability
of an innkeeper as an innkeeper, or to prevent any action being taken against
him in respect of such liability .
4 Liability of innkeeper
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, every innkeeper is liable as an innkeeper
for the loss of or damage to property brought to the inn by any guest, whether
or not the loss or damage was caused by the default or negligence of another

an innkeeper in respect of any property brought to the inn.
