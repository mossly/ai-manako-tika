Maintenance, Advancement, and Protective Trusts
40 Power to apply income for maintenance, etc, and to accumulate surplus
income during a minority
(1) Where any property is held by a trustee in trust for any person for any interest
whatsoever, whether vested or contingent, then, subject to any prior interests or
charges af fecting that property ,—
(a) during the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues,
the trustee may , at his sole discretion, pay to his parent or guardian, if
any , or otherwise apply for or towards his maintenance or education
(including past maintenance or education) or his advancement or beneﬁt,
the whole or such part, if any , of the income of that property as may , in
all the circumstances, be reasonable, whether or not there is—
(i) any other fund applicable to the same purpose; or
(ii) any person bound by law to provide for his maintenance,
education, advancement, or beneﬁt; and
(b) if the person on attaining the age of 21 years has not a vested interest in
that income, the trustee shall thenceforth pay the income of that property
and of any accretion thereto under subsection (2) to him until he either
attains a vested interest therein or dies, or until failure of his interest:
Provided that, in deciding whether the whole or any part of the income of the
property is during a minority to be paid or applied for the purposes aforesaid,
the trustee shall have regard to the age of the infant and his requirements and
generally to the circumstances of the case, and in particular to what other
income, if any , is applicable for the same purposes; and where the trustee has
notice that the income of more than one fund is applicable for those purposes,
then, so far as practicable, unless the entire income of the funds is paid or
applied as aforesaid or the Court otherwise directs, a proportionate part only of
the income of each fund shall be so paid or applied.
(2) During the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues, the
trustee shall accumulate all the residue of that income in the way of compound
interest by investing the same and the resulting income thereof from time to
time in authorised investments, and shall hold those accumulations as follows:
(a) if any such person—
(i) attains the age of 21 years, or marries under that age, and his
interest in the income during his infancy or until his marriage is a
vested interest; or
(ii) on attaining the age of 21 years or on marriage under that age
becomes entitled to the property from which the income arose in
fee simple absolute or determinable, or absolutely — the trustee
shall hold the accumulations in trust for that person absolutely , but
without prejudice to any provision with respect thereto contained
in any settlement by him made under any statutory powers during
his infancy , and so that the receipt of that person after marriage,
and though still an infant, shall be a good discharge; and
(b) in any other case the trustee shall, notwithstanding that that person had a
vested interest in the income, hold the accumulations as an accretion to
the capital of the property from which the accumulations arose and as one
fund with that capital for all purposes,—
s 40 TRUSTEE ACT 1956
Service 0556,301

but the trustee may , at any time during the infancy of that person if his interest
so long continues, apply those accumulations, or any part thereof, as if they
were income arising in the then current year.
(3) This section applies in the case of a contingent interest only if the limitation or
trust carries the intermediate income of the property , but it applies to a future or
contingent legacy by the parent of, or a person standing in the place of a parent
to, the legatee, if and for such period as, under the general law , the legacy carries
interest for the maintenance of the legate; and in any such case as last aforesaid
the rate of interest shall (if the income available is suf f icient and subject to any
rules of Court to the contrary) be 4% per annum.
(4) This section applies to a vested annuity in like manner as if the annuity were the
income of property held by a trustee in trust to pay the income thereof to the
annuitant for the same period for which the annuity is payable, save that in any
case accumulations made during the infancy of the annuitant shall be held in
trust for the annuitant or his personal representatives absolutely .

41 Power to apply capital for maintenance, etc

capital asset subject to a trust, for the maintenance or education (including past
maintenance or education), or the advancement or beneﬁt, in such manner as he
may in his absolute discretion think ﬁt, of any person entitled to the capital of
the trust property or of any share thereof, whether absolutely or contingently on
his attaining any speciﬁed age or on the occurrence of any other event, or
subject to a gift over on his death under any speciﬁed age or on the occurrence
of any other event, and whether in possession or in remainder or reversion, and
any such payment or application may be made notwithstanding that the interest
of that person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment
or revocation, or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which he
belongs:
Provided that—
(a) the money or asset so paid or applied for the maintenance, education,
advancement, or beneﬁt of any person shall not exceed altogether half of
the presumptive or vested share or interest of that person in the trust
property where the value of that share or interest exceeds 1,000 pounds,
and in any other case shall not exceed altogether 500 pounds in amount
or value; and
(b) where that person or any other person is or becomes absolutely and
indefeasibly entitled to the share of the trust property in which that person
had a presumptive or vested interest when the money or asset was so paid
or applied, that money or asset shall be brought into account as part of
that share in the trust property; and
(c) no such payment or application. shall be made so as to prejudice any
person entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or
contingent, in the money or asset paid or applied unless that person is in
existence and of full age and consents in writing to the payment or
application, or unless the Court, on the application of the trustee, so
orders.

part, waive the condition or release any obligation undertaken or any security
given by reason of the condition.

imposed such a condition may pay or apply in exercise of the power, any money

this trust of the said income shall fail or determine:
(b) if the trust aforesaid fails or determines during the subsistence of the trust

such act or omission or decision of a trustee by which he will be aggrieved, may
apply to the Court to review the act or omission or decision or to give directions
in respect of the anticipated act or omission or decision; and the Court may
require the trustee to appear before it, and to substantiate and uphold the
grounds of the act or omission or decision that is being reviewed, and may make
such order in the premises as the circumstances of the case may require:
Provided that no such order shall—
(a) disturb any distribution of the trust property made without breach of trust
before the trustee became aware of the making of the application to the
Court:
(b) af fect any right acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable
consideration.
(2) Where any such application is made, the Court may ,—

direction is subsequently invalidated, overruled, set aside, or otherwise rendered
of no ef fect:
Provided that this subsection shall not extend to indemnify any trustee in respect
of any act done in accordance with any such direction if he has been guilty of
any fraud or wilful concealment or misrepresentation in obtaining the direction

70 Powers of Court to give judgment in absence of a trustee
Where in any proceedings the Court is satisﬁed that diligent search has been
made for any person who, in the character of trustee, is made a defendant in any
action, to serve him with a process of the Court, and that he cannot be found, the
s 70 TRUSTEE ACT 1956
Service 0560,303

Court may hear and determine the proceedings and give judgment therein
against that person in his character of a trustee as if he had been duly served, or
had entered an appearance in the action, and had also appeared by his counsel
and solicitor at the hearing, but without prejudice to any interest he may have in
the matters in question in the proceedings in any other character.

72 Commission
(1) The Court may , out of the property subject to any trust, allow to any person who
is or has been a trustee thereof or to that person’s personal representative such
commission or percentage for that person’s services as is just and reasonable:
Provided that the aggregate commission or percentage so allowed in respect of
all persons who are or have been trustees shall not exceed 5%.
(2) No such allowance shall be so made except on the termination of the trust,
unless the Court otherwise orders.
(3) Where the Court allows a commission or percentage under this section in any
case in which 2 or more persons arc or have been the trustees, whether acting at

particular, may divide the amount in unequal shares or may make the allowance
to one or more of the trustees to the exclusion of the other or others.

otherwise, is of may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the
transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the
commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably , and ought
fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the
directions of the Court in the matter in which he committed the breach, then the
Court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the
same.

the consent in writing of a beneﬁciary , the Court may , if it thinks it, and
notwithstanding that the beneﬁciary may be a married woman restrained from
anticipation, make such order as to the Court seems just for impounding all or
any part of the interest of the beneﬁciary in the trust estate by way of indemnity
to the trustee or persons claiming through him.
(2) This section applies to breaches of trust committed as well before as after the
commencement of this Act.

reason to believe may be made,—
(a) to or against the estate or property that he is administering; or
s 75 TRUSTEE ACT 1956
Service 0561,301

(b) against the trustee personally by reason of his being under any liability in
respect of which he is entitled to reimburse himself out of the estate or
property that he is administering—
the trustee may serve upon the claimant or the person who may become a
claimant as aforesaid a notice calling upon him, within a period of 3 months
from the date of service of the notice, to take legal proceedings to enforce the
claim and also to prosecute the proceedings with all due diligence.
(2) At the expiration of that period the trustee may apply to the Court for an order
under subsection (3), and shall serve a copy of the application on the person
concerned.
(3) If on the hearing of that application that person does not satisfy the Court that
he has commenced the proceedings and is prosecuting them with all due
diligence, the Court may make an order—
(a) extending the period, or barring the claim, or enabling the trust property
to be dealt with without regard to the claim; and
(b) imposing such conditions and giving such directions, including a
direction as to the payment of the costs of or incidental to the application,
as to the Court seems just.
(3A) Where a trustee has served any such notices in respect of claims on 2 or more
persons and the period speciﬁed in each of the said notices has expired, he may ,
if he thinks ﬁt, apply for an order in respect of the claims of those persons in a
single application, and the Court may on that application make an order
accordingly .
(4) This section shall apply to every such claim as aforesaid, whether the claim is
or may be made under the Law Reform (T estamentary Promises) Act 1949 or as
creditor or next of kin or beneﬁciary under the trust or otherwise:
Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to any claim under the Family
Protection Act 1955, and no order made under this section shall af fect any
application for revocation of any grant of administration, whether that

entitled to the estate or property need not be made parties to the proceedings,
and no order made by the Court on the application shall prejudice their right to
contest the claim of the trustee to be entitled to indemnify himself out of the
estate or property that he is administering if they have not been parties to the
proceedings in which the order was made.

76 Distribution of shares of missing beneﬁciaries
(1) Where any property is held by a trustee and the property or any part thereof
cannot be distributed because the trustee does not know whether any person
who is or may be entitled thereto is or at any material date was in existence, or
whether all or any of the persons who are members of any class who are or may
s 75LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 561,302

be entitled thereto are or at any material date were in existence, or because the
trustee does not know whether any such person is alive or dead or where he is,
the trustee may publish such advertisements (whether in New Zealand or
elsewhere) as are appropriate in the circumstances calling upon every such
person and every person claiming through any such person to send in his claim
within a time to be speciﬁed in the advertisements, not being less than 2 months
in any case from the date on which the advertisement is published. Where the
trustee is in doubt as to what advertisement should be published under this
subsection, he may apply to the Court for directions in that regard.
(2) Where the trustee has received (whether as a result of the advertisements or not)
any claim to be a person to whom any such advertisement relates, or any notice
that any person may claim to be such a person, but the trustee is not satisﬁed that
the claim is or would be valid, the trustee may serve upon the claimant or the
person of whom the trustee has notice as aforesaid, a notice calling upon him,
within a period of 3 months from the date of service of the notice, to take legal
proceedings to enforce the claim, if he wishes to pursue it, and to prosecute the
proceedings with all due diligence; and advising him that, if he fails to do so, his
claim may be disregarded and application may be made to the Court without
further notice for an order authorising the distribution of the property . Nothing
in this subsection shall make it necessary for the trustee to serve such a notice
on any such person; and the Court may make an order under this section,
whether or not such a notice has been served on any such person, if it is satisﬁed
that the information supplied to the trustee by that person or otherwise in the
possession of the trustee indicates either that the person is not one of the persons
speciﬁed in the advertisements or that he is not likely to be one of those persons.
(3) Upon proof by af f idavit of the circumstances, and of the inquiries that have been
made, and of the results of the inquiries and advertisements, and of the claims
of which the trustee has received notice, and of the notices that the trustee has
given to claimants under subsection (2), and of the action (if any) which the
claimants have taken to enforce their claims, the Court may order that the trustee
may distribute the property or part thereof, subject to such conditions as the
Court may impose,—
(a) as if every person and every member of any class of persons speciﬁed in
the order (being all or any of the persons speciﬁed in the advertisements)
is not in existence or never existed or has died before a date or event
speciﬁed in the order; and
(b) where as a consequence of the order it is not possible or practicable to
determine whether or not any condition or requirement af fecting a
beneﬁcial interest in the property or any part thereof has been complied
with or fulﬁlled, as if that condition or requirement had or had not been
complied with or fulﬁlled (as the Court may determine).
(4) In making any order under subsection (3), the Court may—
(a) disregard (without express reference thereto in the order) the claims of
any persons who do not appear to the Court to be, or to be likely to be,
any of the persons speciﬁed in the advertisements:
(b) disregard (without express reference thereto in the order) the claim of any
person to whom the trustee has given notice under subsection (2) and
who has failed to take legal proceedings to enforce the claim or to
prosecute any such proceedings with all due diligence:
s 76 TRUSTEE ACT 1956
Service 0561,303

(c) exclude from the operation of the order any person to whom the trustee
has not given notice under subsection (2) and who in the opinion of the
Court may be one of the persons speciﬁed in the advertisements, or any
person whom the Court considers should for any reason be excluded from
the operation of the order:
(d) provide that the order shall not be acted on for such period or except on
such conditions as may be speciﬁed in the order or that the ef fect of the
order shall during a period so speciﬁed be advertised in such manner and
form as may be speciﬁed in the order, or that the order be served upon
such person or persons as are speciﬁed therein; and in the event of the
Court exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this paragraph it may in the
order direct that the same shall be of no ef fect in respect of any person
speciﬁed therein in the event of that person instituting proceedings in
New Zealand to enforce his claim and serving the proceedings upon the
trustee within such period as is speciﬁed in the order.
(5) Any such order may be made notwithstanding that there has not been strict
compliance with any directions as to advertisements previously given by the
Court, or that an error has been made in any advertisement (whether or not any
directions have previously been given by the Court) if the Court considers that
the error would not be likely to have prejudiced or misled the persons to whom
the advertisement relates.
(6) Where the Court makes an order under this section that the trustee may
distribute any property or part thereof as if every person and every member of
any class of persons speciﬁed in the order (not being a person expressly
excluded from the operation of the order) is not in existence or never existed or
has died before a date or event speciﬁed in the order, and the trustee distributes
in accordance with the order, the trustee shall be exonerated from any further
liability to any such person or to any member of any such class:
Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any remedy which any
person may have against any person other than the trustee, including any right
which he may have to follow the property and any money or property into which
it is converted.
(7) The Court may make one or more orders under this section in respect of the
same property .
(8) Any order made under this section may direct how the costs of the order and of
advertising under or for the purposes of the order shall be borne.
(9) It shall not be necessary to serve notice of an application for an order under this
section upon any person, unless the Court otherwise orders.
(10) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of the trustee (if he so desires)
to distribute under any other law or statutory provision or prejudice the
protection thereby af forded when he makes distribution pursuant to any such
law or provision.

held to attend the order of the Court:
Provided that any such money or securities may be paid or transferred by the

and (i):
(ii) debentures, bonds, and stock (other than shares) in which the
trustee is authorised to invest trust money:
(iii) any other asset bearing interest or carrying the right to a dividend
if the interest or dividend is payable at a ﬁxed rate and if the
interest or dividend has been paid regularly in respect of the asset
for at least 5 years before the material date and if the trustee has
no reason to believe that the interest or dividend in respect of the
period to which the apportionment relates will not be paid
reasonably promptly after the same falls due:
Service 0563,301

(b) the term shares means shares or stock of any company , whether
incorporated in or outside New Zealand, except any such shares or stock
which constitutes a ﬁxed-income asset in accordance with paragraph
(a)(iii) of this subsection:
(c) an appropriation of shares (whether pursuant to the power conferred by
section 15(1)(j) or otherwise) shall be deemed to be a transfer of those
shares to which subsection (4) applies.
(2) Where any payment received by a trustee in respect of a sale of any
ﬁxed-income asset is or includes payment for the right to receive income
accrued from that asset at the time of sale, though the income may not then be
due, the amount of the accrued income shall, for the purposes of the trust, be
deemed to have been received as income in respect of the period during which
it so accrued.
(3) Where any payment made by a trustee in respect of a purchase of any
ﬁxed-income asset is or includes payment for the right to receive any income
accrued from that asset at the time of the purchase, though the income may not
then be due, the amount of the accrued income when received shall, for the
purposes of the trust, be deemed to have been received as purchase money
repaid.
(4) Where a trustee transfers any shares (not being a ﬁxed-income asset) to the
person entitled thereto under the trust, then, unless the trustee in his absolute
discretion having regard to all the circumstances of the case thinks that it is
equitable, practicable, and convenient to make an apportionment, there shall be
no apportionment of any dividends which have accrued at the date of transfer
but have not then been declared, and no person who would have been
beneﬁcially interested in any such dividends if they had been declared and paid
to the trustee shall have any claim in respect thereof against the trustee or
against the transferee of the shares.
(5) Where a trustee sells any shares that are not a ﬁxed-income asset, no part of the
proceeds of the sale shall, for the purposes of the trust, be deemed to have been
paid for the right to receive dividends which have accrued in respect of the
shares at the time of the sale, but have not then been declared, and there shall
accordingly be no apportionment of the proceeds as between capital and
income.
(6) Where a trustee purchases any shares that are not a ﬁxed-income asset, no part
of the purchase price shall, for the purposes of the trust, be deemed to be paid
for the right to receive any dividends which have accrued in respect of the
shares at the time of the purchase but have not then been declared, and there
shall accordingly be no apportionment of the purchase price as between capital
and income, nor shall any part of the dividends received by the trustee be
deemed to have been received as purchase money repaid.
(7) Except as herein expressly provided, nothing in this section shall af fect the
rights and obligations of the trustee or of any other person in respect of
apportionment of income on the sale or purchase of any asset or the transfer
thereof to any person beneﬁcially entitled thereto.
(8) Anything done by a trustee before the commencement of this section which
would have been authorised by this section if then in force shall be deemed to
have been authorised by this section.
