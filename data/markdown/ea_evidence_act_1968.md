Act 1968.

other person, and without the consent of the other person, or for the defence of
the other person, at every stage of the proceedings, if—

of fence punishable on summary conviction, the information against him
or her has been withdrawn or dismissed; or

his or her inspection, and may thereupon make such use of it for the purposes
of the trial as he or she thinks ﬁt.

Protection of witnesses
16 Cross-examination as to credit
(1) If any question put to a witness upon cross-examination relates to a matter not
relevant to the proceeding, except in so far as it af fects the credit of the witness
by injuring his or her character, it is the duty of the Court to decide whether or
not the witness is compelled to answer it, and the Court may , if it thinks ﬁt, warn
the witness that he or she is not obliged to answer it.
(2) In exercising this discretion the Court must have regard to the following
considerations—
(a) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the
imputation conveyed by them would seriously af fect the opinion of the
Court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he or she
testiﬁes:
s 14LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 8402

(b) such questions are improper if the imputation they convey relates to
matters so remote in time or of such a character that the truth of the
imputation would not af fect, or would af fect in a slight degree only , the
opinion of the Court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to
which he or she testiﬁes:
(c) such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the
importance of the imputation made against the witness’s character and
the importance of his or her evidence.
(3) Nothing in this section may be deemed to make any witness compellable to give
evidence upon any matter he or she is now by law privileged from disclosing.
17 Indecent or scandalous questions
The Court must forbid any question it regards as—
(a) indecent or scandalous, although such question may have some bearing
on the case before the Court, unless the question relates to facts in issue,
or to matters necessary to be known in order to determine whether or not
the facts in issue existed; or
(b) intended to insult or annoy , or needlessly of fensive in form,
notwithstanding that such question may be proper in itself.
18 Prohibited questions not to be published
(1) It is not lawful for any person to print or publish any question or inquiry which
the Court—
(a) has forbidden or disallowed; or
(b) has warned the witness he or she is not obliged to answer, and has
ordered must not be published.
(2) Every person who prints or publishes any question in breach of this section
commits a contempt of Court.
Miscellaneous
19 Confession after promise, threat, or other inducement
A confession tendered in evidence in any criminal proceeding must not be
rejected on the ground that a promise or threat or any other inducement (not
being the exercise of violence or force or other form of compulsion) has been
held out to or exercised upon the person confessing, if the Judge or other
presiding of f icer is satisﬁed that the means by which the confession was
obtained were not in fact likely to cause an untrue admission of guilt to be made.
20 Criminating questions
Nothing in this Act takes away or af fects the privilege of any witness to refuse
to answer any question which may tend to criminate him or her.
20A Evidence of complainant in rape cases

(a) the sexual experience of the complainant with any person other than the
accused; or
(b) the reputation of the complainant in sexual matters, except by leave of the
Judge.
(3) The Judge must not grant leave under subsection (2), unless he or she is satisﬁed
that the evidence to be given or the question to be put is of such direct relevance
to—
(a) facts in issue in the proceeding; or
(b) the issue of the appropriate sentence, as the case may require, that to
exclude it would be contrary to the interests of justice.
Provided that any such evidence or question must not be regarded as being of
such direct relevance by reason only of any inference it may raise as to the
general disposition or propensity of the complainant in sexual matters.
(4) Despite subsection (2), leave is not required—
(a) to the giving of evidence or the putting of a question for the purpose of
contradicting or rebutting evidence given by any witness, or given by any
witness in answer to a question, relating, in either case, to—
(i) the sexual experience of the complainant with any person other
than the accused; or
(ii) the reputation of the complainant in sexual matters; or
(b) where the accused is charged as a party , and cannot be convicted unless
it is shown that a person other than the accused committed a rape of fence
against the complainant, to the giving of evidence or the putting of a
question relating to the sexual experience of the complainant with that
other person.
(5) Nothing in this section authorises evidence to be given or questions to be put
that could not be given or put apart from this section.
(6) An application for leave under subsection (2)—

(1986–87 No 22).]

s 20ALA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 8404

(inclusive) of the Crimes Act 1969 or for any other of fence of a sexual nature,
no corroboration of a complainant’s evidence is necessary for the accused to be
convicted; and in any such case the Judge is not required to give any warning to
the jury relating to the absence of corroboration.
(2) If, in any such case, the Judge decides to comment on the absence of any
evidence tending to support any other evidence, no particular form of words is
required.

Part 2
Documentary evidence
21 Interpretation and savings
(1) In this Part—
document [Repealed]
statement includes any representation of fact, whether made in words or
otherwise
proceedings includes arbitrations and references, and “Court” must be
construed accordingly .
(2) Nothing in this Part—
(a) prejudices the admissibility of any evidence which would, apart from the
provisions of this Part, be admissible; or
(b) enables documentary evidence to be given as to any declaration relating
to a matter of pedigree, if that declaration would not have been
admissible as evidence if this Part had not been passed.
[Section 21 document: repealed, on 10 December 2011, by Schedule clause 3(2) of the Digital
Registers Act 2011 (2011 No 11).]
22 Admissibility of documentary evidence as to facts in issue
(1) In any civil or criminal proceedings where direct oral evidence of a fact would
be admissible, any statement made by a person in a document and tending to
establish that fact is, on production of the original document, admissible as
evidence of that fact if the following conditions are satisﬁed, that is to say—
(a) if the maker of the statement either—
(i) had personal knowledge of the matters dealt with by the
statement; or
(ii) where the document in question is or forms part of a record
purporting to be a continuous record, made the statement (in so far
as the matters dealt with thereby are not within his or her personal
knowledge) in the performance of a duty to record information;
and
(b) if the maker of the statement is called as a witness in the proceedings:
Provided that the condition that the maker of the statement be called as a witness
need not be satisﬁed if he or she is dead, or unﬁt by reason of his or her bodily
or mental condition to attend as a witness, or if he or she is beyond the seas and
it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance, or if all
reasonable ef forts to ﬁnd him or her have been made without success, or if no
party to the proceedings with a right to cross-examine the maker of the
statement requires him or her to be called as a witness.
(2) In any civil or criminal proceedings the Court may at any stage of the
proceedings order that such a statement as is mentioned in subsection (1) is
admissible as evidence, or may , without any such order having been made,
admit such a statement in evidence—
(a) notwithstanding that the maker of the statement is available but is not
called a witness:
Service 08901

(b) notwithstanding that the original document is not produced, if in lieu
thereof there is produced a copy of the original document or of the
material part thereof certiﬁed to be a true copy in such manner as may be
speciﬁed in the order or as the Court may approve, as the case may be.
(3) For the purposes of this section a statement in a document is not deemed to have
been made by a person unless the document or the material part thereof was
written, made, or produced by him or her with his or her own hand, or was
signed or initialled by him or her or otherwise recognised by him or her in
writing as one for the accuracy of which he or she is responsible.
(4) For the purpose of deciding whether or not a statement is admissible as evidence
by virtue of the foregoing provisions, the Court may draw any reasonable
inference from the form or contents of the document in which the statement is
contained, or from any other circumstances, and may , in deciding whether or not
a person is ﬁt to attend as a witness, act on a certiﬁcate purporting to be the
certiﬁcate of a medical of f icer, and where the proceedings are with a jury , the
Court may in its discretion reject the statement, notwithstanding that the
requirements of this section are satisﬁed with respect thereto, if for any reason
it appears to it to be inexpedient in the interests of justice that the statement
