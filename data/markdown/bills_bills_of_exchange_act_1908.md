Part 1
Bills of Exchange
Forms and Interpretation
3 “Bill of exchange” deﬁned
(1) A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person
to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is
addressed to pay on demand, or at a ﬁxed or determinable future time, a sum
certain in money to or to the order of a speciﬁed person or to bearer.
(2) An instrument that does not comply with these conditions, or that orders any act
to be done in addition to the payment of money , is not a bill of exchange.
(3) An order to pay out of a particular fund is not unconditional within the meaning
of this section: but an unqualiﬁed order to pay , coupled with (a) an indication of
a particular fund out of which the drawee is to reimburse himself or a particular
account to be debited with the amount, or (b) a statement of the transaction
giving rise to the bill, is unconditional.
(4) A bill is not invalid by reason that—
(a) it is not dated:
(b) it does not specify the value given, or that any value has been given,
therefor:
(c) it does not specify the place where it is drawn or the place where it is
payable.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 3
4 Inland and foreign bills
(1) An inland bill is a bill that is, or on the face of it purports to be,—
(a) both drawn and payable in any of the Australasian colonies; or
(b) drawn in any of the Australasian colonies upon some person resident
therein. Any other bill is a foreign bill .
(2) Unless the contrary appears on the face of the bill the holder may treat it as an
inland bill.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 4
5 How bills may be drawn
(1) A bill may be drawn payable to or to the order of the drawer; or it may be drawn
payable to or to the order of the drawee.
(2) Where in a bill drawer and drawee are the same person or where the drawee is
a ﬁctitious person or a person not having capacity to contract, the holder may
treat instrument, at his option, either as a bill of exchange or as a promissory
note.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 5
6 Address to drawee
(1) The drawee must be named or otherwise indicated in a bill with reasonable
certainty .
(2) A bill may be addressed to two or more drawees, whether they are partners or
s 2LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 490,302

not; but an order addressed to 2 drawees in the alternative, or to 2 or more
drawees in succession, is not a bill of exchange.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 6
7 Certainty required as to payee
(1) Where a bill is not payable to bearer, the payee must be named or otherwise
indicated therein with reasonable certainty .
(2) A bill may be made payable—
(a) to two or more payees jointly; or
(b) in the alternative to one of two, or one or some of several payees; or
(c) to the holder of an of f ice for the time bring.
(3) Where the payee is a ﬁctitious or non-existing person the bill may be treated as
payable to bearer.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 7
8 What bills are negotiable
(1) Where a bill contains words prohibiting transfer, or indicating an intention that
it is not transferable, it is valid as between the parties thereto, but is not
negotiable.
(2) A negotiable bill may be payable either to order at to bearer.
(3) A bill is payable to bearer if it is expressed to be so payable, or if the only or the
last indorsement thereon is an indorsement in blank.
(4) A bill is payable to order if it is expressed to be so payable, or if it is expressed
to be payable to a particular person and does not contain words prohibiting
transfer or indicating an intention that it is not transferable.
(5) Where a bill, either originally or by indorsement, is expressed to be payable to
the order of a speciﬁed person, and not to him or his order, it is nevertheless
payable to him or his order at his option.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 8
9 Sum payable
(1) The sum payable by a bill is a sum certain within the meaning of this Act,
although it is required to be paid—
(a) with interest:
(b) by stated instalments:
(c) by stated instalments, with a provision that upon default in payment of
any instalment the whole shall become due:
(d) according to an indicated rate of exchange, or according to a rate of
exchange to be ascertained all directed by the bill.
(2) Where the sum payable is expressed in words and also in ﬁgures, and there is a
discrepancy between the two, the sum denoted by the words is the amount
payable.
(3) Where a bill is expressed to be payable with interest, unless the instrument
provides otherwise, interest runs from the date of the bill, and, if the bill is
undated, from the issue thereof.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 9
10 Bill payable on demand
(1) A bill is payable on demand—
s 10 BILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT 1908
Service 0490,303

(a) if it is expressed to be payable on demand, or at sight, or on presentation;
or
(b) if no time for payment is expressed therein.
(2) Where a bill is accepted or indorsed when it is overdue, it shall, as regards the
acceptor who so accepts, or any indorser who so indorses it, be deemed a bill
payable on demand.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 10
11 Bill payable at a future time
(1) A bill is payable at a determinable future time within the meaning of this Act if
it is expressed to be payable—
(a) at a ﬁxed period after date or sight:
(b) on or at a ﬁxed period after the occurrence of a speciﬁed event that is
certain to happen, though the time of happening may be uncertain.
(2) An instrument expressed to be payable on a contingency is not a bill, and the
happening of the event does not cure the defect.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 11
12 Omission of date in bill payable after date
Where a bill expressed to be payable at a ﬁxed period after date is issued
undated, or where the acceptance of a bill payable at a ﬁxed period after sight
is undated, any holder may insert therein the true date of issue or acceptance,
and the bill shall be payable accordingly:
Provided that (a) where the holder in good faith and by mistake inserts a wrong
date, and (b) in every case where a wrong date is inserted, if the bill
subsequently comes into the hands of a holder in due course, it shall not be
avoided by the insertion of a wrong date, but shall operate and be payable as if
the date so inserted had been the true date.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 12
13 Antedating and postdating
(1) Where a bill or an acceptance or any indorsement on a bill is dated, the date
shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be the true date of the
drawing, acceptance, or indorsement, as the case may be.
(2) A bill is not invalid by reason only that it is antedated or postdated, or that it
bears date on a Sunday .
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 13
14 Computation of time of payment
Where a bill is not payable on demand the day on which it falls due is
determined as follows:
(a) 3 days (called “days of grace”) are, in every case where the bill itself does
not provide otherwise, added to the time of payment as ﬁxed by the bill,
and the bill is due and payable on the last day of grace:
Provided that when the last day of grace is a non-business day the bill is
due and payable on the next following business day .
(b) where a bill is payable at a ﬁxed period after date, after sight, or after the
happening of a speciﬁed event, the time of payment is determined by
excluding the day from which the time is to begin to run and by including
the day of payment:
s 10LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 490,304

(c) where a bill is payable at a ﬁxed period after sight, the time begins to run
from the date of the acceptance if the bill is accepted, and from the date
of noting or protest if the bill is noted or protested for non-acceptance or
for non-delivery:
(d) the term month in a bill means calendar month.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 14
[Section 14(a): amended, on 12 October 1960, by section 13 of the Statutes Amendment Act 1946
(1946 No 40).]
15 Referee in case of need
The drawer of a bill and any indorser may insert therein the name of a person
to whom the holder may resort in case of need — that is to say , in case the bill
is dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment. Such person is called the
referee in case of need. It is in the option of the holder to resort to the referee
in case of need or not, as he thinks ﬁt.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 15
16 Optional stipulations by drawer or indorser
The drawer of a bill, and any indorser, may insert therein an express
stipulation—
(a) negativing or limiting his own liability to the holder:
(b) waiving as regards himself some or all of the holder’s duties.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 16
17 Deﬁnition and requisites of acceptance
(1) The acceptance of a bill is the signiﬁcation by the drawee of his assent to the
order of the drawer.
(2) An acceptance is invalid unless it complies with the following conditions,
namely:
(a) it must be written on the bill and be signed by the drawee; the mere
signature of the drawee without additional words is suf f icient:
(b) it must not state that the drawee will perform his promise by any other
means than the payment of money .
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 17
18 Time for acceptance
(1) A bill may be accepted—
(a) before it has been signed by the drawer, or while otherwise incomplete:
(b) when it is overdue, or after it has been dishonoured by a previous refusal
to accept, or by non-payment.
(2) Where a bill payable after sight is dishonoured by non-acceptance, and the
drawee subsequently accepts it, the holder, in the absence of any dif ferent
agreement, is entitled to have the bill accepted as on the date of its ﬁrst
presentment to the drawee for acceptance.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 18
19 General and qualiﬁed acceptances
(1) An acceptance is either (a) general, or (b) qualiﬁed.
(2) A general acceptance assents without qualiﬁcation to the order of the drawer: a
qualiﬁed acceptance in express terms varies the ef fect of the bill as drawn.
s 19 BILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT 1908
Service 0490,305

(3) In particular, an acceptance is qualiﬁed which is—
(a) conditional — that is to say , which makes payment by the acceptor
dependent on the fulﬁlment of a condition therein stated:
(b) partial — that is to say , an acceptance to pay part only of the amount for
which the bill is drawn:
(c) local — that is to say , an acceptance to pay only at a particular speciﬁed
place. An acceptance to pay at a particular place is a general acceptance,
unless it expressly states that the bill is to be paid there only and not
elsewhere:
(d) qualiﬁed as to time:
(e) the acceptance of some one or more of the drawee, but not of all.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 19
20 Inchoate instruments
(1) Where a simple signature on a blank stamped paper is delivered by the signer in
order that it may be converted into a bill, it operates as a prima facie authority
to ﬁll it up as a complete bill for any amount the stamp will cover, using the
signature for that of the drawer, or the acceptor or an indorser; and in like
manner, where a bill is wanting in any material particular the person in
possession of it has a prima facie authority to ﬁll up the omission in any way he
thinks ﬁt.
(2) In order that any such instrument when completed may be enforceable against
any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be ﬁlled
up within a reasonable time, and strictly in accordance with the authority given.
Reasonable time for this purpose is a question of fact:
Provided that if any such instrument after completion it negotiated to a holder in
due course, it shall be valid and ef fectual for all purposes in his hands, and he
may enforce it as if it had been ﬁlled up within a reasonable rime and strictly in
accordance with the authority given.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 20
21 Delivery
(1) Every contract on a bill, whether it is the drawer’s, the acceptor’s, or an
indorser’s, is incomplete and revocable until delivery of the instrument in order
to give ef fect thereto:
Provided that where an acceptance is written on a bill, and the drawee gives
notice to or according to the directions of the person entitled to the bill that he
has accepted it, the acceptance then becomes complete and irrevocable.
(2) As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than the
holder in due course, the delivery—
(a) in order to be ef fectual must be made either by or under the authority of
the party drawing. accepting, or indorsing, as the case may be:
(b) may be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose only , and
not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.
(3) If the bill is in the hands of a holder in due course, a valid delivery of the bill
by all parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him is conclusively
presumed.
(4) Where a bill is no longer in the possession of a party who has signed it as
drawer, acceptor, or indorser, a valid and unconditional delivery by him is
presumed until the contrary is proved.

Compare: 1883 No 8 s 21
Capacity and Authority of Parties
22 Capacity of parties
(1) Capacity to incur liability as a party to a bill is co-extensive with capacity to
contract:
Provided that nothing in this section shall enable a corporation to make itself
liable as a drawer, acceptor, or indorser of a bill unless it is competent to it so
to do under the law for the time being in force relating to corporations.
(2) Where a bill is drawn or indorsed by a minor or corporation, having no capacity
or power to incur liability on a bill, the drawing or indorsement entitles the
holder to receive payment of the bill and to enforce it against any other party
thereto.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 22
23 Signature essential to liability
No person is liable as drawer, indorser, or acceptor of a bill unless he has signed
it as such:
Provided that—
(a) where a person signs a bill in a trade or assumed name, he is liable
thereon as if he had signed it in his own name:
(b) the signature of the name of a ﬁrm is equivalent to the signature by the
person so signing of the names of all persons liable as partners in that
ﬁrm.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 23
24 Forged or unauthorised signature
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a bill is forged, or is
placed thereon without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to
be, the forged or unauthorised signature is wholly inoperative, and no right to
retain the bill or to give a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof
against any party thereto can be acquired through or under that signature unless
the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment of the bill is
precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority .
(2) Nothing in this section shall af fect the ratiﬁcation of an unauthorised signature
not amounting to a forgery .
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 24
25 Signature by procuration
A signature by procuration operates as notice that the agent has but a limited
authority to sign, and the principal is bound by such signature only if the agent
in so signing was acting within the actual limits of his authority .
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 25
26 Person signing as agent or representative
(1) Where a person signs a bill as drawer, indorser, or acceptor, and adds words to
his signature indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal, or in a
representative character he is not personally liable thereon: but the mere
s 26 BILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT 1908
Service 0490,307

addition to his signature of words describing him as an agent, or as ﬁlling a
representative character, does not exempt him from personal liability .
(2) In determining whether a signature on a bill is that of the principal, or that of the
agent by whose hand it is written, the construction most favourable to the
validity of the instrument shall be adopted.

The Consideration for a Bill
27 V alue, and holder for value
(1) V aluable consideration for a bill may be constituted by—
(a) any consideration suf f icient to support a simple contract:
(b) an antecedent debt or liability . Such a debt or liability is deemed valuable
consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at a future time.
(2) Where value has at any time been given for a bill, the holder is deemed to be a
holder for value as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill who became
parties prior to that time.
(3) Where the holder of a bill has a lien on it, arising either from contract or by
implication of law , he is deemed to be a holder for value to the amount of the
sum for which he has a lien.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 27
28 Accommodation party
(1) An accommodation party to a bill is a person who has signed a bill as drawer,
acceptor, or indorser without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of
lending his name to some other person.
(2) An accommodation party is liable on the bill to a holder for value: and it is
immaterial whether, when such holder took the bill, he knew such party to be an
accommodation party or not.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 28
29 Holder in due course
(1) A holder in due course is a holder who has taken a bill, complete and regular on
the face of it, under the following conditions namely:
(a) that he became the holder of it before it was overdue and without notice
that it had been previously dishonoured if such was the fact:
(b) that he took the bill in good faith and for value, and that at the time the
bill was negotiated to him, he had no notice of any defect in the title of
the person who negotiated it:
(2) In particular the title of a person who negotiates a bill is defective within the
meaning of this Act when he obtained the bill, or the acceptance thereof, by
fraud, duress, or force and fear or other unlawful means, or for an illegal
consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such
circumstances as amount to a fraud.
(3) A holder (whether for value or not) who derives his title to a bill through a
holder in due course, and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality
af fecting it, has all the rights of that holder in due course as regards the acceptor
and all parties to the bill prior to that holder.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 29
30 Presumption of value and good faith
(1) Every party whose signature appears on a bill is prima facie deemed to have
become a party thereto for value.
(2) Every holder of a bill is prima facie deemed to be a holder in due course; but if
in an action on a bill it is admitted or proved that the acceptance, issue, or
subsequent negotiation of the bill is af fected with fraud, duress, or force and
s 30 BILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT 1908
Service 0490,351

fear, or illegality , the burden of proof is shifted, unless and until the holder
proves that, subsequent to the alleged fraud or illegality , value has in good faith
been given for the bill.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 30
Negotiation of Bills
31 Negotiation of bill
(1) A bill is negotiated when it is transferred from one person to another in such a
manner as to constitute the transferee the holder of the bill.
(2) A bill payable to bearer is negotiated by delivery .
(3) A bill payable to order is negotiated by the indorsement of the holder completed
by delivery .
(4) Where the holder of a bill payable to his order transfers it for value without
indorsing it, the transfer gives the transferee such title as the transferor had in
the bill, and the transferee in addition acquires the right to have the indorsement
of the transferor.
(5) Where any person is under obligation to indorse a bill is a representative
capacity , he may indorse the bill in such terms as to negative personal liability .
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 31
32 Requisition of a valid indorsement
An indorsement in order to operate as a negotiation must comply with the
following conditions, namely:
(a) it must be written on the bill itself and be signed by the indorser; the
simple signature of the indorser on the bill, without additional words, is
suf f icient:
Provided that an indorsement written on an allonge, or on a “copy” of a
bill issued or negotiated in a country where “copies” are recognised, shall
be deemed to be written on the bill itself:
(b) It must be an indorsement of the entire bill. A partial indorsement — that
is to say , an indorsement that purports to transfer to the indorsee a part
only of the amount payable, or to transfer the bill to two or more
indorsees severally — does not operate as a negotiation of the bill:
(c) where a bill is payable to the order of two or more payees or indorsees
who are not partners, all must indorse, unless the one indorsing has
authority to indorse for the others:
(d) where in a bill payable to order the payee or indorsee is wrongly
designated, or his name is misspelt, he may indorse the bill as therein
described, adding, if he thinks ﬁt, his proper signature:
(e) where there are two or more indorsements on a bill, each indorsement is
deemed to have been made in the order in which it appears on the bill,
until the contrary is proved:
(f) an indorsement may be either special or in blank; it may also contain
terms making it restrictive.

33 Conditional indorsement
Where a bill purports to be indorsed conditionally . the condition may be
disregarded by the payer, and payment to the indorsee is valid whether the
condition has been fulﬁlled or not.

34 Indorsement in blank, and special indorsement
(1) An indorsement in blank speciﬁes no indorsee, and a bill so indorsed becomes
payable to bearer.
(2) A special indorsement speciﬁes the person to whom, or to whose order, the bill
is to be payable.
(3) The provisions of this Act relating to a payee apply , with the necessary
modiﬁcations, to an indorsee under a special indorsement.
(4) Where a bill has been indorsed in blank, any holder may convert the blank
indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above the indorser’s
signature a direction to pay the bill to or to the order of himself or some other
person.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 34
35 Restrictive indorsement
(1) An indorsement is restrictive which prohibits the further negotiation of the bill,
or which expresses that it is a mere authority to deal with the bill as thereby
directed and not a transfer of the ownership thereof — as, for example, if a bill
is indorsed “Pay D only”, or “Pay D for the account of X”, or “Pay D or order
for collection”.
(2) A restrictive indorsement gives the indorsee the right to receive payment of the
bill, and to sue any party thereto that his indorser could have sued, but gives him
no power to transfer his rights as indorsee unless it expressly authorises him to
do so.
(3) Where a restrictive indorsement authorises further transfer, all subsequent
indorsees take the bill with the same rights and subject to the same liabilities as
the ﬁrst indorsee under the restrictive indorsement.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 35
36 Negotiation of overdue or dishonoured bill
(1) Where a bill is negotiable in its origin, it continues to be negotiable until it has
been either restrictively indorsed, or discharged by payment or otherwise.
(2) Where an overdue bill is negotiated, it can be negotiated only subject to any
defect of title af fecting it at its maturity , and thenceforward no person who takes
it can acquire or give a better title than that which the person from whom he
took it had.
(3) A bill payable on demand is deemed to be overdue within the meaning and for
the purposes of this section when it appears on the face of it to have been in
circulation for an unreasonable length of time. What is an unreasonable length
of time for this purpose is a question of fact.
(4) Except where an indorsement bears date after the maturity of the bill, every
negotiation is prima facie deemed to have been ef fected before the bill became
overdue.
(5) Where a bill that is not overdue has been dishonoured, any person who takes it
with notice of the dishonour takes it subject to any defect of title attaching
thereto at the time of dishonour: but nothing in this subsection shall af fect the
rights of a holder in due course.

37 Negotiation of bill to party already liable thereon
Where a bill is negotiated back to the drawer, or to a prior indorser, or to the
acceptor, such party may , subject to the provisions of this Act, reissue and
further negotiate the bill; but he is not entitled to enforce payment of the bill
against any intervening party to whom he was previously liable.
Compare: 1883 No 8 s 37
38 Rights of the holder
The rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follow:
(a) he may sue on the bill in his own name:
(b) where he is a holder in due course, he holds the bill free from any defect
of title of prior parties, as well as from mere personal defences available
to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment against all
parties liable on the bill:
(c) where his title is defective,—
(i) if he negotiates the bill to a holder in due course, that holder
obtains a good and complete title to the bill; and
(ii) if he obtains payment of the bill, the person who pays him in due
course gets a valid discharge for the bill.

before presenting it for payment is excused, and does not discharge the drawer
and indorsers.

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a bill payable after sight is
negotiated, the holder must either present it for acceptance or negotiate it within

42 Non-acceptance
Where a bill is duly presented for acceptance and is not accepted within the

(2) Presentment for payment is dispensed with—
(a) where, after the exercise of reasonable diligence, presentment as required
