Part 2
Modiﬁcation of laws applicable to international trusts
6 Perpetuity period
(1) Despite any rule of law or equity to the contrary , the rule of law known as the
rule against perpetuities or remoteness of vesting, and the rule of law known as
the rule against perpetual trusts or against inalienability , shall each have no
application to an international trust.
(2) Despite subsection (1), a trust instrument may make provision for vesting of all
or any part of the property of the trust upon such terms as are prescribed by the
trust instrument including, but not limited to, provision for—
(a) a period within which the property of a trust shall vest in any beneﬁciary
of the trust; or
(b) the happening of an event upon which the property of the trust vests in
any beneﬁciary of the trust; or
(c) the property of the trust not to vest in any beneﬁciary of the trust or the
trust not to terminate.
(3) Where a trust would, except for this subsection, be held by the Court to be void
for uncertainty because of its terms relating to termination of the trust or vesting
of the property of the trust, and such uncertainty would be removed by imposing
a date for termination of that trust, then the trust terminates on the date
100 years from the date of creation of the trust, and the property of the trust
vests in the beneﬁciaries on that date, unless termination or vesting occurs
earlier in accordance with the trust instrument.
(4) Where a period or an event is speciﬁed within, or at the end of, or upon which
the property of a trust shall vest in a beneﬁciary or where subsection (3) applies,
the property of the trust then remaining shall vest in the beneﬁciary in
accordance with the provision which speciﬁes that period or event or in
accordance with subsection (3) (as the case may be), and such vesting applies in
relation to all property then remaining of that trust and every general or special
power of appointment under that trust must be exercised in a manner consistent
therewith.
(5) Without limiting any other rights conferred on trustees to vary a trust
instrument, the trustees of an international trust may with the prior consent of
the interested parties, or if permitted by the trust instrument, vary the terms of
the trust instrument to make provision—
(a) for a period being not less than the existing period provided for in the
trust instrument within which the property of the trust shall vest in any
beneﬁciary of the trust; or
(b) for the happening of an event being an event that will occur beyond the
period within which the property of the trust would otherwise vest in the
beneﬁciaries and upon the happening of which the property of the trust
shall vest in any beneﬁciary of the trust; or
(c) to remove the period within which the property of the trust shall vest in
any beneﬁciary .
(6) Except where there is express provision to the contrary contained in the trust
instrument, where the proper law of an international trust is to be changed from
Service 0240,801

that of the Cook Islands to that of another jurisdiction, the trustees may with the
consent of the interested parties, or if permitted by the trust instrument, vary the
terms of the trust instrument to provide for a lesser period in which the then
remaining property of the trust shall vest in any beneﬁciary so as not to infringe
the law of that other jurisdiction.
[Section 6: replaced, on 21 November 1996, by section 5 of the International Trusts Amendment
Act 1995–96 (1995–96 No 25).]
7 Execution of trust instrument
Despite any rule of law or equity to the contrary and except where there is
express provision to the contrary contained in the trust instrument, a trust
instrument and any counterpart thereof (whether an original or copy including a
facsimile copy) may be executed by the settlor, trustee and any other parties
thereto at dif ferent times and in dif ferent places whether within or outside the
Cook Islands and a trust instrument so executed and a trust thereby created
established or settled whether registered before or after the coming into force of
this Act deemed as valid as if the trust instrument were executed by the settlor
and those parties simultaneously at the time the trust instrument was executed
by the settlor, and at a place within the Cook Islands.
[Section 7: replaced, on 21 November 1996, by section 6 of the International Trusts Amendment
Act 1995–96 (1995–96 No 25).]
8 Abolition of rule against double possibilities
The rule of law prohibiting the limitation, after a life interest of an unborn
person, of an interest in land to the unborn child or other issue of an unborn
person is hereby abolished, but without prejudice to any other rule relating to
perpetuities.
9 Abolition of rule against accumulations
(1) Where property is settled or disposed of in such manner that the income thereof
may or must be accumulated wholly or in part the power or direction to
accumulate that income is valid if the disposition of the accumulated income is
or may be valid but not otherwise.
(2) Nothing in this section af fects the power of any person to terminate an
accumulation that is for that person’s beneﬁt, or any jurisdiction or power of the
Court to maintain or advance out of accumulations, or any powers of a trustee
under any Act or law or under any instrument creating a trust or making a
disposition.
(3) For the purposes of this Act the following enactments are repealed—
(a) sections 41 and 42 of the Property Law Act 1952:
(b) sections 2 of the Property Law Amendment Act 1963.
(4) The enactments repealed by subsection (3) and the corresponding provisions of
any former enactment, are deemed in connection with the law applicable to
international trusts, never to have applied to any power to accumulate.
[Section 9(2): amended, on 3 March 1999, by section 3 of the International Trusts Amendment
Act 1999 (1999 No 3).]
10 Application of rule in Saunders v V autier
(1) Despite any rule of law or equity to the contrary , where a trust instrument
empowers a trustee to accumulate income, or to refrain from making any
s 6LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 240,802

distribution of capital or income until a speciﬁed date or event, or where any
provision of the trust instrument otherwise prevents the making of any
distribution of capital or income, notwithstanding that a beneﬁciary may , but for
this section, otherwise be entitled to that accumulation or distribution, the
trustee may , in their absolute discretion, subject to any other express terms of
the instrument, give ef fect to that direction as they think ﬁt notwithstanding that
a beneﬁciary requests the trustee to immediately distribute the accumulation or
distribution and will give a valid discharge to the trustee for such distribution.
(2) Despite anything contained in any Act to the contrary or any rule of law or
equity , the power to vary the terms of a trust or disposition so as to vary or
remove the direction to accumulate income or distribute capital of the trust or to
modify or remove the discretion of the trustee to accumulate income or
distribute capital has no application where subsection (1) applies.
[Section 10(1): replaced, on 3 March 1999, by section 4(a) of the International Trusts Amendment
Act 1999 (1999 No 3).]
[Section 10(2): amended, on 3 March 1999, by section 4(b) of the International Trusts Amendment
Act 1999 (1999 No 3).]
11 Power of revocation
(1) Unless an international trust contains an express power of revocation it is
deemed to be irrevocable by the settlor and his or her legal personal
representatives notwithstanding that it is voluntary .
(2) Despite the repeal of section 11 of the principal Act every matter, act or thing
done pursuant to that section before the coming into force of this Act shall, if
such matter, act or thing was validly done, remain so valid after the coming into
force of this Act as if that section had not been repealed.
[Section 11: replaced, on 8 September 1989, by section 5 of the International Trusts Amendment
Act 1989 (1989 No 23).]
12 Charitable and purpose trusts
(1) Despite any rule of law to the contrary an international trust is deemed to be
charitable or for purposes which are charitable where it is a trust substantially
for one or more of the following objects or purposes, namely—
(a) for the relief of poverty:
(b) for the advancement of education:
(c) for the advancement of religion:
(d) for other purposes beneﬁcial to the community:
Notwithstanding that the object or purposes may not be of a public nature or for

(1) For the purposes of identiﬁcation and ease of administration, the trustees of an
international trust may adopt a name for that trust.
(2) A trust instrument may authorise the trustees to cause the ownership or title of
property of the trust to be recorded or registered in the name of that international
trust rather than in the name of the trustees.
(3) Where the trustees of a trust cause the ownership or title of property of that trust
to be recorded or registered in the name of that trust, the trustees must where
permitted by the jurisdiction of the relevant registry lodge with the relevant
registry or recording authority an af f idavit, which af f idavit must contain the
following particulars namely—
(a) the name of the international trust:
(b) the names and addresses of all the trustees:
(c) whether fewer than all the trustees are authorised to act on behalf of and
in the name of the trust in any acquisition, conveyance, encumbrance,
lease or other dealing with the property and if so—
(i) designate the trustees or the manner in which the trustees shall be
designated:
(ii) specify the limitations (if any) upon the authority of such trustees:
(iii) be executed by all the trustees named pursuant to paragraph (b):
(d) where the af f idavit does not provide for the matters contained in
paragraph (c) then it must be executed by at least one trustee named
therein.
(4) Upon lodging an af f idavit with the relevant registry or recording authority the
af f idavit constitutes prima facie evidence of the facts recited therein, the
authority of the deponent to execute and lodge the af f idavit, and the authority of
s 12LA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS

the trustees who are thereby empowered to convey or otherwise act on behalf of
the trust insofar as the same af fects title to any interest in the property .
(5) Subject to subsection (3), where an interest in property is recorded or registered
in the name of an international trust, such interest must only be conveyed,
encumbered, leased or otherwise dealt with in the name of the trust by an
instrument executed by all the trustees named in the af f idavit.
(6) Where an interest in property is recorded or registered in the name of an
international trust pursuant to the trust instrument, the legal title to that property
is deemed to be held by the trustees.
(7) In the event of a change in any of the particulars contained in an af f idavit under
subsection (3) the trustees for the time being must provide a further af f idavit in
accordance with that subsection.

Despite any provision of the law of the settlor’s domicile or place of ordinary
residence or the settlor’s current place of incorporation and notwithstanding
further that an international trust is voluntary and without valuable consideration
being given for the same, or is made on or for the beneﬁt of the settlor, settlor’s
spouse or children of the settlor or any of them, an international trust and a
disposition to an international trust is not void or voidable in the event of the
settlor’s bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation (other than in the case of an
international company registered pursuant to the International Companies
Act 1981–82 that is in liquidation) or in any action or proceedings at the suit of

13B Fraud
(1) Where it is proven beyond reasonable doubt by a creditor that an international
trust settled or established or property disposed to an international trust—
(a) was so settled established or disposed by or on behalf of the settlor with
principal intent to defraud that creditor of the settlor; and
(b) did at the time such settlement establishment or disposition took place
render the settlor, insolvent or without property by which that creditor’s
claim (if successful) could have been satisﬁed,
then such settlement establishment or disposition is not void or voidable and the
international trust liable to satisfy the creditor’s claim out of the property which
but for the settlement establishment or disposition would have been available to
satisfy the creditor’s claim and such liability shall only be to the extent of the
interest that the settlor had in the property prior to settlement establishment or
disposition and any accumulation to the property (if any) subsequent thereto.
(2) In determining whether an international trust, settled or established or a
disposition, has rendered the settlor insolvent or without property by which a
creditor’s claim (if successful) may be satisﬁed, regard must be had to the fair
market value of the settlor’s property , (not being property of or relating to the
trust) at the time immediately after the settlement establishment or the
disposition referred to in subsection (1)(b) and in the event that the fair market
value of such property exceeded the value of the creditor’s claim, at that time,
after the settlement establishment or disposition, then the trust so settled or
established or the disposition is for all purposes deemed not to have been so
settled established or the property disposed of with intent to defraud the creditor.
(3) An international trust settled or established and a disposition to such trust is for
all purposes deemed not to have been so settled or established, or the property
disposed of with intent to defraud a creditor—
(a) if settled established or the disposition takes place after the expiration of
2 years from the date that creditor’s cause of action accrued; or
(b) where settled, established or the disposition takes place before the
expiration of 2 years from the date that the creditor’s cause of action
accrued, that creditor fails to commence in a court of competent
jurisdiction proceedings in respect of that creditor’s cause of action
before the expiration of 1 year from the date such settlement established
or disposition took place;
provided that this subsection does not have ef fect if, and subject to
subsection (5), at the time of settlement, establishment, or disposition, as the
case may be, proceedings in respect of that creditor’s cause of action against that
settlor have already been commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(4) An international trust settled or established and a disposition of property to such
trust is for all purposes deemed not to have been so settled or established, or the
property disposed of with intent to defraud a creditor if the settlement
establishment or disposition of property took place before that creditor’s cause
of action accrued.
(5) A settlor must not have imputed to him or her an intent to defraud a creditor,
solely by reason that the settlor—
(a) has settled or established a trust or has disposed of property to such trust
within 2 years from the date of that creditor’s cause of action accruing:
s 13B INTERNA TIONAL TRUSTS ACT 1984
Service 0241,001

(b) has retained, possesses or acquires any of the powers or beneﬁts referred
to in section 13C(a) to (f):
(c) is a beneﬁciary , trustee, or protector:
(d) has settled or established a trust, or has disposed of property to such trust,
at a time when proceedings in respect of that creditor’s cause of action
against that settlor have already been commenced in a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(6) Where an international trust is liable to satisfy a creditor’s claim in the manner
provided for in subsection (1)—
(a) the creditor’s rights to recovery is limited to that property referred to in
subsection (1), or to the proceeds of that property , to the exclusion of any
rights against the trustees of the international trust or any of them, against
any other property of the international trust, or against any other of the
property or assets of the trustees of the international trust, or any of them:
(b) where the international trust is unable to satisfy the creditor’s claim by
reason of the fact that the property referred to in subsection (1) has been
disposed of, other than to a bona ﬁde purchaser for value, then any such
disposition is void.
(7) For the purpose of this section the onus of proof of the settlor’s intent to defraud
the creditor lies on the creditor.
(8) For the purposes of this section, and section 13K—
(a) the date of the cause of action accruing is, the date of that act or omission
which is relied upon to either partly or wholly establish the cause of
action, and, if there is more than one act or the omission is a continuing
one, the date of the ﬁrst act or the date that the omission has ﬁrst
occurred, as the case may be, is the date that the cause of action has
accrued:
(b) cause of action means the earliest cause of action capable of assertion by
a creditor against the settlor of an international trust or, as the case may
be, against the settlor of property upon an international trust, by which
that creditor has established (or may establish) an enforceable claim
against that settlor:
(c) where a creditor has, or asserts, or could have asserted, multiple or
successive causes of action against a settlor (whether by virtue of the
nature of the relevant circumstances of the case, or by reason of having
attained the status of a judgement creditor in respect of one or more of
such causes of action, or by reason of asserting or being able to assert an
allegedly fraudulent settlement of or disposition to an international trust,
or otherwise) the entitlement of such a creditor to relief under this
section must be determined, and the periods referred to in this
section must be calculated with reference to one only of the creditor’s
causes of action, being that cause of action which accrued ﬁrst in time in
accordance with paragraph (b):
(d) nothing in paragraphs (b) or (c) applies so as to af fect the right or
requirement of a creditor to commence separate proceedings under this
section in relation to a cause of action which is separate from and
independent of another cause of action where the Court is satisﬁed,
having regard to paragraph (c), that both the circumstances out of which
the cause of action arose and the subject matter of that cause of action are
wholly unrelated to those of the other cause of action.
s 13BLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 241,002

(9) The provisions of this section apply to all civil actions and proceedings brought
in the Court in which fraud, deceit, unconscionable conduct or any other
inequitable conduct however described or any species of unjust enrichment is
alleged, against any person (whether a party to the proceedings or not) with
regard to the settlement or establishment of an international trust or the
disposition of property to such a trust, or receipt of property by or for such a
trust (or subsequent disposition of property from such a trust with the intention
of prejudicing creditors of the settlor of such property or such trust), and the
remedy conferred by subsection (1) is the sole remedy available in such an
action or proceedings, to the exclusion of any other relief or remedy against any
party to the relevant action or proceeding.
(10) The provisions of this section operate to the exclusion of any other remedy ,
principle or rule of law , whether provided for by statute, or founded in equity or
in common law including, for the avoidance of doubt, the imposition of a
constructive trust upon any interested party or the recognition and enforcement
of any constructive trust imposed or recognised by the laws of any other
jurisdiction.
(11) Subject to section 16(6), the provisions of this section apply to every
international trust, and to every trust which having been registered as an
international trust, is no longer so registered, and in respect of all dispositions to
such a trust.
(12) For the purposes of this section creditor means a creditor of the settlor and
includes any person who alleges a cause of action against a settlor.
(13) A creditor seeking to enforce a claim under this section in reliance on a foreign
judgement may not enforce such claim until such time as it can demonstrate to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Court that,
(a) it has exhausted all remedies available to it against the settlor’s remaining
property , and
(b) all rights of appeal against that foreign judgement have been exhausted.
(14) For the purposes of assessing the liability of an international trust to a creditor
under this section, where the amount of that creditor’s claim against the settlor
is, wholly or partly , in any way related to or evidenced by a foreign judgement,
the Court in making any award in favour of that creditor must disregard and
exclude any amount awarded in that foreign judgement to that creditor which
comprise any form of exemplary , vindictive, retributory or punitive damages (by
whatever name), or is an amount of damages arrived at by doubling, trebling or
otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage
(which types of damage are in this section together called punitive damages ).
(15) The burden of proof is on a creditor to establish that an amount awarded in a
foreign judgement does not wholly or partly comprise punitive damages.
(16) Subsection (14) does not apply if, at the time of settlement, establishment, or
disposition, as the case may be, an award of punitive damages has already been
made in a foreign judgement against a settlor.

contrary , it is lawful for an instrument or disposition to provide that any estate
or interest in any property given or to be given to any beneﬁciary shall not
during the life of that beneﬁciary or such lesser period as may be speciﬁed in the
instrument or disposition be alienated or pass by bankruptcy , insolvency or

13G Governing law
(1) In determining the governing law of an international trust regard must ﬁrst be
had to the terms of that trust and to any evidence therein as to the intention of
the parties; and the other circumstances of an international trust may be taken
into account only if the terms of the trust fail to provide such evidence.
(2) A term of an international trust expressly selecting the laws of the Cook Islands
to govern the trust is valid, ef fective and conclusive regardless of any other
circumstances.
(3) Where a trust instrument so provides, or where in accordance with the powers
contained in a trust instrument, the law of the Cook Islands is chosen to govern
a particular aspect of an international trust, and law other than that of the Cook
Islands is chosen to govern other aspects of that trust, then the choice of Cook
Islands law and the choice of that other law as to their respective aspects is valid
ef fective and conclusive regardless of any other circumstances.
(4) Where a trust instrument contains a power to change the governing law of that
trust, that law may be changed to or from the law of the Cook Islands in
accordance with that power, and that change is valid, ef fective and conclusive
according to the terms of such power.
(5) A change in governing law does not af fect the legality or validity of, or render
any person liable for, any thing done before the change.
(6) A change in the governing law of a trust does not of itself interrupt the
s 13G INTERNA TIONAL TRUSTS ACT 1984
Service 0241,201

continuity of the relationships whether in equity or law established by the trust
and, without limitation, does not constitute a resettlement of the trust.
(7) Subject to any other provision of this Act, the application of the governing law
of a trust to that trust prior to a change in that governing law is not af fected by
that change.
(8) The disposition of any property to or from a trust in accordance with the
governing law of that trust at the time of the disposition is not avoided or
otherwise invalidated by a subsequent change from that governing law to some
other law .
(9) Where the donee of a power to change or cause to change the governing law of
a trust exercises that power in accordance with the terms of the power so
conferred, then the exercise of that power by the donee is deemed to have been
properly exercised.
(10) The location of the interested parties, selection or imposition of jurisdiction,
place of administration, or the situation of the property of the trust does not in
any way af fect the validity or ef fect of a choice of the governing law of a trust
made in accordance with the trust instrument.
(11) Where the governing law of a trust is changed to or from the law of the Cook
Islands, the trustees are empowered to make all such consequential alterations or
additions to the trust instrument as the trustees consider necessary or desirable
to ensure the provisions, rights, liabilities, powers and obligations of and under
the trust instrument are as valid and ef fective under the new governing law as
they were under the previous governing law .
(12) Where a trust instrument contains provision for the governing law of a trust to
change upon a determination being made in accordance with the trust deed as to
either—
(a) the happening or non-happening of a speciﬁed event; or
(b) a state of af fairs coming into existence,
and that determination as to the happening or non-happening of the event or the
existence of the state of af fairs is so made then that provision takes ef fect
accordingly .
(13) Nothing in this section af fects the application of section 13K(5) to an
international trust.

the limited liability of a custodian trustee, nor charge remuneration as
both a managing trustee and a custodian trustee.

is transferred to a trustee or trustees, other than to all of the trustees of an
international trust, with the intention that it be held by that trustee or those
trustees as trust property , then such transfer has the same ef fect as if the property

time of the disposition did not have notice of the intention to defraud the third
party .
