Service 0340,501

or more of the proceedings for a writ or order in the nature of mandamus,
prohibition or certiorari or for a declaration or injunction against that person in
any such proceedings.
(2) Where on an application for review the applicant is entitled to an order declaring
that a decision made in the exercise of a statutory power of decision is
unauthorised or otherwise invalid, the Court may , instead of making such a
declaration, set aside the decision.
(3) Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary , it is not a bar to the grant of
relief in proceedings for a writ or an order of or in the nature of certiorari or
prohibition, or to the grant of relief on an application for review , that the person
who has exercised or is proposing to exercise a statutory power was not under
a duty to act judicially , but this subsection must not be construed to enlarge or
modify the grounds on which the Court may treat the applicant as being entitled
to an order of or in the nature of certiorari or prohibition under the foregoing
provisions of this section.
(4) Where in any of the proceedings referred to in subsection (1) the Court had,
before the commencement of this Part, a discretion to refuse to grant relief on
any grounds, the Court has the like discretion, on like grounds, to refuse to grant
relief on an application for review .
(5) Subsection (4) does not apply to the discretion of the Court before the
commencement of this Part, to refuse to grant relief in any of the said
proceedings on the ground that the relief should have been sought in any other
of the said proceedings.
(6) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this section, on an
application for review in relation to the exercise, refusal to exercise or purported
exercise of a statutory power of decision, the Court, if it is satisﬁed that the
applicant is entitled to relief under subsection (1) may , in addition to or instead

any person whose act or omission is the subject-matter of the application, to
reconsider and determine, either generally or in respect of any speciﬁed matters,
the whole or any part of any matter to which the application relates. In giving
any such direction the Court must—
(a) advise the person of its reasons for so doing; and
(b) give to that person such directions as the Court thinks just as to the
reconsideration or otherwise of the whole or any part of the matter that is
referred back for reconsideration; and
(c) require the person to report back to the Court as to the decisions taken
when the matter was reconsidered.
(7) If the Court gives a direction under subsection (6), the Court may make an order
that it could make by way of interim order under section 50F and that section
applies accordingly , so far as it is applicable and with all necessary
modiﬁcations.
(8) Where any matter is referred back to any person under subsection (6)—
(a) that person has jurisdiction to reconsider and determine the matter in
accordance with the Court’s direction notwithstanding anything in any
other enactment; and
s 50BLA WS OF THE COOK ISLANDS
Service 0 340,502

interim order made by the Court under subsection (7), to have ef fect
according to its tenor unless and until it is revoked or amended by that
person.

person to whom it is so referred must have regard to the Court’s reasons for
giving the direction and to the Court’s directions.
50C Defects in form or technical irregularities
On an application for review in relation to a statutory power of decision, where
the sole ground of relief established is a defect in form or a technical
irregularity , if the Court ﬁnds that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred, it may refuse relief and where the decision has already been made,
may make an order validating the decision notwithstanding the defect or
irregularity , to have ef fect from such time and on such terms as the Court thinks
ﬁt.
50D Disposal of proceedings for mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari
Where proceedings are commenced for a writ or order of or in the nature of
mandamus, prohibition or certiorari in relation to the exercise, refusal to
exercise or the proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power, the
proceedings must be treated and disposed of as if they were an application for
review .
50E Disposal of proceedings for declaration or injunction
Where proceedings are commenced for a declaration or injunction or both,
whether with or without a claim for some other relief, and the exercise, refusal
to exercise, or proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power is an issue in

in respect of or arising out of the same transaction or event or series of
transactions or events is alleged to exist, whether jointly , severally , or in the

entitled, without any amendment, but any defendant, though unsuccessful, may

plaintif f, or where it is doubtful whether it has been commenced in the name of
the right plaintif f, the Court may at any time, if satisﬁed that it has been so

(1) All persons may be joined as defendants in one action against whom the right to

no interest.

of the persons severally , or jointly and severally , liable on any one contract,

which is liable, and to what extent, may be determined as between all parties.

the evidence in the af f idavit.

of claim or any amended statement of claim, and the Registrar, on the request of
the plaintif f, must issue a new summons as if the action had not previously been
heard; and thereafter, should there be a second hearing, judgment must be given
thereat either for the plaintif f or for the defendant without any election of
nonsuit.

Where—
(a) after a plaintif f has been nonsuited; or

a subsequent action for the same or substantially the same cause of action is

was nonsuited or the proceedings were struck out, the Judge may stay the

she thinks ﬁt.

appears that they can be disposed of more conveniently together than separately .

defendant who has set up a counter-claim may proceed with the counter-claim
against the other plaintif f.
193 Injunctions
(1) In any proceedings in which an injunction has been or might have been claimed,
a plaintif f may , before or after judgment, apply for an injunction to restrain the
defendant from—

(a) the repetition or continuance of the wrongful act or breach of contract
complained of; or
(b) the commission of any wrongful act or breach of contract of a like kind,
relating to the same property or right or arising out of the same
contract,—
and the Judge, in addition to giving judgment for such damages and costs as the
plaintif f may be entitled to, may grant the injunction on such terms as may be
just.
(2) An application under this rule may be made—
(a) before the hearing, of the proceedings, in accordance with rule 132; or

The parties may after an action has been commenced, concur in stating the
questions of law arising in the action in the form of special case for the opinion
of the Court. Every such special case must be divided into paragraphs numbered
consecutively , and must concisely state such facts and documents as may be
necessary to decide the questions raised thereby . On the argument of such case
the Court and the parties are at liberty to refer to the whole contents of such
documents, and the Court is at liberty to draw from the facts and documents
r 197 CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OF THE HIGH COUR T 1981
Service 0348,203

stated in any such special case any inference, whether of fact or of law , which
might have been drawn therefrom if proved at the trial.
198 Leave to set down case required in certain cases
No special case in an action to which an infant or person of unsound mind is a
party may be set down for argument without leave of the Court or a Judge, the
application for which must be supported by suf f icient evidence that the
statements contained in such special case, so far as the same may af fect the
interest of the infant, or person of unsound mind, are true.
199 Mode of setting case down for argument
Either party may set down a special case for argument by delivering to the
Registrar a notice in Form No 46 and also, if an infant or person of unsound
mind is a party to the action, producing a copy of the order giving leave to set
down the same for argument.
200 Court may give judgment or order trial
On the argument of such point of law the Court may give judgment in the
action, or may order the issues of fact or any of them to be tried before giving
